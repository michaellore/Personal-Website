====== Welcome ======
I'm Michael Lore.

I'm an Interactive Multimedia graduate from The College of New Jersey interested in IT, games, books, history, and all things tech.

This is my personal website and serves as a repository for my [[Knowledgebase|Personal Knowledgebase]], other projects, random musings, and anything else I find interesting.
