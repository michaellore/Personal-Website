====== Creating network share drives and mapping the drive for a user ======

An important part of business infrastructure is having shared folders across the network. 

	* First, find or create the appropriate folders on the server
	* In AD Users and Computers, create security groups for each folder and add the appropriate users to them
		* Open up the user properties, Member Of tab, Add button
	* Right click on the folder you want to share and select Properties > Security tab > Advanced
	* Choose 'Disable inheritance', then choose 'Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions...'
	* Remove permissions from default groups that shouldn't have them for the folder, such as the catch-all Users group
	* Press Add > Select a principal
	* Type in the group name or indiivual user you want to give access and check the appropriate permissions box
	* Close the dialog box, then go to the Sharing tab in folder properties
	* Press Share, then select the group/user you just gave permission to and choose the appropriate permission level
	* Note the Network Path of the folder in the Share tab
	
	The folder on the server:

To map the drive for the user:

	* Ensure the user is logged in to the correct account
	* Open up File Explorer > right click This PC > Map Network Drive
		* Or choose Computer in the top bar > Map Network Drive
	* Direct the user to type in the Network Path of the folder
		* Or choose Browse and find the folder graphically
	* Choose a drive letter and ensure the 'reconnect at sign-in' box is checked'
	
	The folder on the user's PC:
