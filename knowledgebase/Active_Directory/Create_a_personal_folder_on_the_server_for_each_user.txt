====== Create a personal folder on the server for each user ======

Often you will want to have users be members of groups that all share certain shared folders, such as Reports, Marketing Materials, etc. But users should also have access to a personal folder that is not shared with the group but is still on the server.

First, follow the steps for creating a networked folder outlined in [[Creating network share drives and mapping the drive for a user]]

In this example we have created a Security Group called Personal and added the users 'patty' and helpdesk' to the group, and we have created the Personal folder and given it the correct permissions.

We want this Personal folder to be a 'Home Directory' of sorts for users.

	* Open up AD Users and Computers, find the user you want to give a Personal folder to, and open up their Properties.
	* Choose the Profile tab
	* In the Home Folder dialog, choose Connect and select a drive letter
	* Add the Network Path of the Personal folder on the server, and then add \%username%
		* \\Server2016\Personal\%username%
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	* On the next sign-in this folder will be created for the user and automatically mapped
