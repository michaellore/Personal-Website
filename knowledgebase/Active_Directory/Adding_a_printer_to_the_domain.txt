====== Adding a printer to the domain ======

	* Assign a static IP to the printer you want to add
	* Open Print Management in the Server Manager
	* Right click > Add Printer
	* Choose the appropriate option - search for a printer already on the network or add one by IP address
	* Right click on the printer > Properties > Sharing Tab and ensure the printer is shared and give it a share name
	* Optionally add the printer to the director for it to be listed in AD
	* Go to Security tab and adjust permissions - remove Everyone and add specific groups

To add the printer as a user:

	* Open control panel > Devices and Printers
	* Add a printer
	* Choose "the printer I want is not listed"
	* Choose "Select a shared printer by name" or "find a printer in the directory"
	* Enter the printer name in \\ServerName\PrinterName format
		* if you chose to find the printer in the directory, look for the printer in the search results screen
	* The printer will be added

Some modern orgs have printer ops in the cloud, where they use an App in the cloud - users log in and see a list of printers they can access and simply click and install.
