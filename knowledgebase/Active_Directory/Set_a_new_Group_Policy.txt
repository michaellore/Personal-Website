====== Set a new Group Policy ======

Often you want to have specific policies in place for certain groups or indviduals

In this case we will apply a policy to Disable Task Manager for all users in the 'Human Resources' organizational unit

	* Open up Group Policy Management
	* Right click on Group Policy Objects in the left panel and select New, then give it a name
	* Choose User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > System > Ctrl + Alt + Del
	* Select Remove Task Manager
	* Choose Enabled

Now the new policy needs to be enabled for specific users or groups
	* Drag the policy into the 'Human Resources' OU Folder
	* Right click the policy inside of the OU folder and choose "Enforced"
		* This will apply the policy to all users within that OU
Alternatively:
	* Click the policy and choose the Delegation tab
	* Choose Add, and add any specifc users or security groups to apply the policy to them

In our lab we may need to sign out and back in or force an update from the cmd using:
	gpupdate /force

Now we can log in as our 'patty' HR user and see that the task manager is unavailable form right-clicking the taskbar

We can also see that if we run taskmgr from cmd as Patty that we receive an error

However, if we run taskmgr from cmd as admin, using an account that is not a member of the Human Resources OU, the task manager appears correctly.
