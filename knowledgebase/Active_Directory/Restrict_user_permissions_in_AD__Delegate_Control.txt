====== Restrict user permissions in AD / Delegate Control ======

Often you will want to give an employee certain AD abilities without giving them full access to domain settings, such as allowing a Tier 1 helpdesk employee to reset user passwords while not allowing them to change group memberships or create new user accounts.

	* Open up AD Users and Computers
	* Right click on the folder you want to delegate control to and choose Delegate Control
	* Choose Add and enter the name of a user or Security Group to give control to
	* Choose a task to delegate, such as resetting passwords
	* To test, log in to a computer as a user that was just given control
	* Open up AD Users and Computers and find a user profile
	* Go to the Account tab
	* Notice that all options besides "reset password" are grayed out
	* The user can also right click and Reset Password
	* But if the user tries to Disable the account they are met with an error
