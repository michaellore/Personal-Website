====== Groups in Office 365 ======

Groups cut down on tedium - you can email a group instead of dozens of individual people. Assign permissions to a group and then all members get those permissions.
Different types of groups for different situations.

Sharing email and calendar - Microsoft 365 group in Outlook / exchange admin
Collaborate in persistent chat environment / embedded apps - Microsoft Teams
Large open discussion group - Yammer

When you create a group you can be added as a delegate and send mail as or on behalf of that group.
