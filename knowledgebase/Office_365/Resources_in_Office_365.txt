====== Resources in Office 365 ======

Resources are mailboxes assigned to a physical location such as a conference room, or to a piece of equipment that is not location-specific, such as a projector. Users can reserve that room or piece of equipment by including the room mailbox in the meeting request. After creating the room/equipment mailbox, when you are ready to use it, in Outlook:

	* Go to Home>New Items>Meeting, or from the calendar view > New Meeting
	* In the Required field, add the room you just created
	* The room finder panel will appear with available dates and times that the room is open
