====== Contacts and Shared Mailboxes ======

Contacts in O365 are created by administrators and are shown under People to all users in Office 365. Useful for people you email often, vendors, etc - can create mail contacts for people outside of your org. Can be added to distribution groups/lists

Shared mailboxes don't have their own username and password - users don't log in directly. Users must be granted permissions to access, then sign into their personal account and access the shared mailbox through that in Outlook.

You create a shared mailbox in Exchange admin and then delegate access to users - they can open that mailbox in Outlook
