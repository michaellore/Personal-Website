====== Admin Roles ======

Permissions are based on Roles. Roles define what tasks an admin or user can perform. When a role is assigned to a user, that user is granted the permissions provided by the role.

Administrative roles - roles that contain permissions that can be assigned to admins or specialist users that manage a part of Exchange, such as severs or databases

End user - roles that enable users to manage some aspects of their mailboxes and groups

Exchange admin center has some built in role groups, like Compliance, Helpdesk, etc.

Exchange role groups are just for Exchange, Office/MS365 role groups can also grant permissions in Exchange.
