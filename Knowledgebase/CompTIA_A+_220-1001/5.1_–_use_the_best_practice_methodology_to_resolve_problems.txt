Change control - a formal process for managing change
	avoid downtime and confusion
	follow corporate policy
	nothing changes without the process
	
	Change must be planned:
		estimate risk
		have a recovery plan if change doesn't work
		Test before making the change
		Document and get approval
		Finally make the change

Identify the problem - get as many details as you can, try to replicate problem - question users, determine if anything has changed since problem started. Make backups. Check log files.

Establish theory - start with the obvious. Occam's razor - simplest explanation is most likely. Consider everything. Make a list of causes, start with the easiest.

Test theory - if it doesn't work, move on to the next theory or escalate the issue

Create a plan - correct issue with minimum impact, sometimes must be during non-production times. Have multiple plans.

Implement the plan - during change control window, escalate as necessary

Verify system function - test the fix, by yourself or have users test. implement preventative measures

Document your findings - build the knowledge base to prevent future similar issues. Document errors codes, reproduction steps, measures taken to fix
