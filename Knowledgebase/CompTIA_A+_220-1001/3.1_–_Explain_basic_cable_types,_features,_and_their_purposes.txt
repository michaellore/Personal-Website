====== 3.1 â€“ Explain basic cable types, features, and their purposes ======
cabling is the foundation of the network.

most ethernet is twisted pair copper cables - balanced pair operation, two wires with equal and opposite signals. the twist keeps a single wire always moving away from interference, opposite signals compared on the other end. pairs in the same cable have different twist rates.

Cabling is standardized. by multiple orgs. EIA - electronic industries alliance - RS-# or EIA-# standard numbers. TIA - telecom industry association TIA/EIA-568 standard. International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standard

Copper cable categories

Plenum is the are aabove the drop ceiling where HVAC and cabling can be run. Cable jacket traditionally made of PVC, cable in plenum can be sheathed ina fire-rated jacket like flourinated ethylrnr polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Plenum-rated may not be as flexible as traditional cable

UTP - unshielded twisted pair, no shielding under jacket, most common
STP - shielded twisted pair - additional shielding against interference, requires cable to be grounded
U - unshielded, S - braided shielding, F - foil shielding

(overall cable) / individual pairs) TP
	S/FTP = braided around entire cable, foil around pairs
	F/UTP - foil around cable, no shieldinng around pairs

T568A and T568B termination - different pin assignments, T568A for horizontal cabling - on same floor, many orgs use T568B, do not terminate ends of cable with different standards

Coaxial cable - two or more forms share common axis
	RG-6 used in TV/digital cable and internet over cable
	RG-59 used as patch cable

Optic fiber - transmission by light, no RF signal, hard to monitor, signal is slow to degrade, good for long distance, immune to radio interference
	multi mode- light goes into cable and bounces around into multiple modes, short-range communication - 2KM for 100Mbit, 500m for 10Gbit
	singlemode - very long distance, 80km without more processing, expensive light source such as lasers

**Video cables**

VGA - Video graphics array - DB-15 connector (DE-15), blue color standard, analog signal, 5 to 10 meters, degrades at more distance. 15 pins in 3 rows

HDMI - high def multimedia interface - digital, video and audio, 20 meter max, 19-pin type A. Mini-hdmi designed for smaller devices

Displayport - VESA standard, royalty free standard, data sent in packets like internet, can use adapter with hdmi and dvi, U shaped, corner at angle

DVI - digital video inerface - single and dual link, 
	DVI-A - analog
	DVI-D - digital
	DVI-I  - both

**Multipurpose Cables**

Lightning - apple proprietary, 8 pin digital, high power output, inserted both ways, simple design.

Thunderbolt - high speed serial connection, data and power. mini-displayport standard
	V1 - two channel, 10Gbit/s per channel, 20Gbit/s total, mini DP connector
	V2 - 20Gbit/S over aggregated channels
	V3 - 40Gbit/s aggregated
	USB-C connector
	Max 3 meters copper, 60 meters optical, can daisy-chain 6 devices

USB - universal serial bus, printers, sotrage, kb&m
	USB 1.1
		low speed - 1.5Mb/s, 3 meters
		full speed - 12Mb/s, 5 meters
	USB 2.0 -460Mb/s, 5m
	{{.\pasted_image002.png?width=700}}
	
	USB 3.0 (superspeed) - 5Gbit/S, ~3m cable (no standard length)
	{{.\pasted_image003.png?width=700}}
	
	USB 3.1 - superspeed+ - type a and USB C connectors - 10Gbit/S twice the speed of 3.0
	USB 3.2 - new superspeed modes, 10Gbit and 20/Gbit speeds
	
	USB-C can be plugged in either way, but is not necessarily 3.1 standard.
	It must:
		have USB 3.1 speeds
		> 7.5 watt power delivery
		must support alternate mode
	about the same size as micro-B
	
DB-9 serial cable - D-subminiature or D-sub
	different sizes, A thru E
	commonly used to send data over RS-232 connection
	serial comms standard, used in consoles management port

SATA cables - Serial AT attachment, connecting storage devices
	Revision 1.0 - 1.5Gbit/s 1 meter
	2.0 - 3.0Gbit/s 1 meter
	3.0 - 6.0Gbit/s 1 m
	3.2 - 16Gbit/s 1m
	{{.\pasted_image004.png}}
	Data connection runs to motherboard, power comes from power supply

PATA cables - parallel AT attachment - originally called IDE or EIDE
	much older and slower than SATA - 16 Mbit up to 133Mbit
	uses ribbon cables, 40 wire or 80 wire, 40 pin connectors
	molex usually provides power

SCSI standard - small computer systems interface - not reallly "small" anymore - designed to connect many devices
	has many different formats, was used before USB, easy to use, not much configuartion needed
	each device assigned an ID number - logical unit defined inside of ID
Serial attached SCSI increased throughput and flexiblility, no more daisy chains

**Adapters and converters**
convert between interfaces
DVI-D to HDMI, no signal conversion or loss of quality
DVI-A to VGA - only supports 640x480 officially
VGA - DVI digital needs a converter
USB to Ethernet
