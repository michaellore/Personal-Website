====== 4.1 â€“ Compare and contrast cloud computing concepts ======
There are multiple models for cloud computing

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) / Hardware as a Service (HaaS)
	outsource your equipment - you rent the hardware 
	you are responsible for the software, management, updates, and security
	common usage is web server provider
		you rent the physical server but everything else is up to you

Software as a Service (SaaS) 
	on-demand software, no local installation - log into a website to access
		email, payroll
	central management of apps and data by the provider
	a complete offering, like Google Mail, no dev work needed

Platform as a Service (PaaS) - a good middle ground between IaaS and SaaS
	no need to worry about servers, software, or maintenance
	you only need to handle the development of your own software
	develop your app from whats available on the platform - like building blocks
	Salesforce.com - you can buy and configure your app from their modules

Cloud deployment models
	Private - you own your own virtualized local data center
	
	Public - available to everyone - like AWS or Azure
	
	Hybrid - mix, some of your services local, some on public cloud
	
	Community - several organizations sharing the same resources
	
	Multi - combination of two or more public or private clouds depending on what you need from specific providers or regulatory compliance
	
Internal cloud - no reosurces shared, build it yourself so pay for everything upfront, no ongoing costs

External cloud - share resources with public, so no large upfront cost of hardware. Infrastructure owned by third party, costs may be metered or upfront

Metered service - pay for what you use, uploading/downloading/storing all have associated costs

Non-metered - you pay a flat fee for a block of storage/service, no additional cost for use

Rapid elasticity - scale up and down as needed seamlessly, if you are busier at the start or middle of month, you can add more resources then and delete them when not needed

On demand self-service - add additional software, networks, servers, etc as needed easily and instantly

Resource pooling - all computing power in one spot, one big resource instead of many

Measured service - detailed cost and resource usage reports, can more eaily plan for costs 

**Cloud services** - always adding new ones
	Email - a company staple, cloud email allows offsite communication
		no need to host your own email servers or have a dedicated email support team
		flat cost per month - personal options may be free
		Microsoft office 365, google mail
	
	File storage - access, edit and share from anywhere
		easy collaboration
		often has a synchronization app for automatic syncing with pc and phones to cloud
		dorpbox, google drive, onedrive
	
	Virtual app streaming - on demand applications with no installing
		only needed components are downloaded
		user data stored in cloud
		easy to update, no need for each individual to update the app
		new apps can be added to the cloud simply
	
	Cloud-hosted virtual desktops - VDI - users connect to a pre-built desktop
		access from anywhere or any OS
		virtual network - all communications are local to the virtual desktop
			no sensitive info is sent from the local computer
		Amazon Workspaces is a providers
