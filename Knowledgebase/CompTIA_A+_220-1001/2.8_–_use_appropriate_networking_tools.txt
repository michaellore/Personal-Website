cable crimper - pinches the connector onto the wire - metal prongs pushed through insulation of wire for copper-to-copper connection
	good scissors/cable snips, wire stripper can be helpful
	
Multimeter - checks AC voltage from outlets, and DC voltage for pc power supply and checking wires and fuses

tone generator - follow and track wires by playing a tone. generator and probe. connect generator to wire and use probe to find sound

cable tester - tests continuity, find missing pins and crossed wires, doesn't test quality

loopback plug - testing physical ports and fooling apps that expect a connection

punch-down tool - punch a wire into a wiring block, 66 block, 110 block. every wire must be individual punched. good for cable management

wifi analyzer - sees all communication over wifi network, indentify errors, interference
