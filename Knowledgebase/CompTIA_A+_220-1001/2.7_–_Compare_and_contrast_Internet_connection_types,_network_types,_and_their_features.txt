	high speed networking
	
DSL Modems - uses phone lines
	adsl - asymmetric, download faster than upload
	must be close to central office

dialup - uses analog voice telephone lines, very slow, still used in some legacy systems

Fiber - high speed networkingvery fast, HD channels, Gigabit internet, etc

Satellite - non-terrestrial communication, generally high cost, decent speed, good for remote sites, high latency, poor performance in weather

ISDN - integrated services digital network
	BRI - basic rate interface, 2B+D two 64 kbit channels, 1 16kbit signalling channel
	PRI - primary rate interface
		T1 or E1, commonly used by telephone companies to connect to phone systems

Line-of-sight service - visual path between antennas, common in metro areas,covers many homes
	WiMax networking - worldwide interoperability for microwave access, wireless high speed internet, antenna outside your house

LAN - local network, building or group of buildings, high speed

WAN - wide area network - spans the globe, generally slower than the LAN

PAN - perosnal area network - your own private network, bluetooth, IR, NFC

MAN - metropolitan area network - larger than lan, smaller than wan, network in a city, often run by local govt

WMN - wireless mesh network, devices connected together in a mesh 'cloud' - all you IoT devices, self forming and healing
