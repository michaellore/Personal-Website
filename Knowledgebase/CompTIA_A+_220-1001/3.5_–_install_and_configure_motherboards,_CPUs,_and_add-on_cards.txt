====== 3.5 â€“ install and configure motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards ======
Motherboards come in several form factors with diffrent sizes and layouts - important for exam to pick right mb for situation

Standard ATX -> Micro ATX -> Mini ATX

ATX - Advanced Technology Extended, still popular 20 or 24 pin connector types, larger ATX has more slots

MicroATX (uATX) - smaller, with less expansion slots, has backward compat with full size, same power connector

MINI ITX - small form factor, but screw compatible with ATX and micro ATX, low power, good for single purpose PCs like media streaming

Motherboard expansion slots
	Expansion bus - described in bandwidth and clock speed
	1Mhz = 1 million cycles per second
	clock speed does not always eequal transfer rate
	
	PCI - peripheral component interconnect - common expansion interface
		32 and 64 bit width - 64 bit is larger slot
		133,266,533 MB/s throughput based on version (32 bit vs 64, 33Mhz vs 66)
		devices usually get power directly from the slot
			3.3 and 5v notches
				64 bit card also has a 64bit notch

	PCIe - express, has mostly replaced PCI and other expansion types
		communicates seirally, so slower devices dont slow donw everyone
		x1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 lanes, pronounced "by"
		has had multiple versions with increasing speed support
		v1 - 250MB/s
		v2 500MB
		v3 ~1GB
		v4 ~2GB
		v5 ~4GB
		Riser cards can plug into motherboards to help PCIe cards fir into smaller form facotrs like data center servers

**Connectors**
	CPU socket is usually the largest thing on the board and central, can be hard to upgrade
	
	Zero insertion force (ZIF) socket - place cpu in then lower arm, install cpu without applying pressure. the pins match up with the pin grid array (PGA)
	
	Land Grid Array (LGA)  - reverse of PGA, pins are on motherboard. no need to worry about bending cpu pins but easier to damage mb
	
	SATA and PATA connectors
	
	Smaller connectors for front panel items like buttons, usually labeled on the end

**BIOS - basic input output system**
	software used to start the computer - initializes cpu and memory
	POST - power on self-test, diagnostics to see if hardware is ok
	then looks for a boot loader to start the OS
	
	Legacy BIOS - original/traditional BIOS, used by older OSs, limited hardware support
	
	UEFI BIOS - unified extensible firmware interface
		defined standard, designed to replace legacy
		more graphical, easy to use
		supports large hard drives 
		includes pre-boot environment with shell and drivers, rmeote diagnostics
	
	bios configs stored in non-volatile memory on the mb.
		used to use CMOS memory, often had a battery
	
	CMOS battery is often not needed in today's computers, and may be used just to maintain date and time
		bad battery will require bios / datetime config on every boot

**BIOS Options**
	To enter bios, press a key at system start, usually DEL or F1, F2, etc.
	MS and VMWare provide software for BIOS configs in VMs, but VirtualBox does not.
	
	Windows 8 and 10 have Fast Boot to start up very quickly, making it harder to access the BIOS
	
	Can configure and view RAM modules, boot order, hard drive settings, electrical settings, and enabling and disabling CD drives.
	
	BIOS provides always-available diagnostics, focused on hardware checks, not OS checking. 
	
	Always have a backup of BIOS settings

**BIOS Security**
	common secuirty feature is a BIOS password - system wont start without it
	Supervisor password - no bios changes without it
	
	Full disk encryption (FDE) - system is ocmpletely encrypted
		BitLocker on Windows - integrates with TPM - Trusted Platform Module, hardware, sometimes built-in, adds advanced crptographic functions
	
	LoJack for Laptops -originally called CompuTrace, built into BIOS, automatically reinstalled if disabled
		provides tracking, allowd remote access to lock the system/delete files or force a startup password
	
	Secure Boot - Part of UEFI spec, only runs software with correct signature - known good software
		system will not boot if software has been modified

**BIOS Upgrades**
	In older systems, upgrades would be done by physically replacing a chip.
	
	These days you upgrade through software, fix bugs and increase performance.
	You normally only upgrade BIOS for a reason, not willy nilly.
	Identify current bios version in System Information (msinfo32)
	
	Before upgrading, make sure you read the release notes and be connected to a very reliable power source, problems with upgrading can brick the whole system

**CPU Features**
	Dual/Quad/Octa/Multi - core
		each core can have its own cache and the entire chip may have a shared cache
		CPU cache is very small, very fast memory, holds data, instructions, and/or results. temp. holding space
		Level 1 - first check, first storage
		Level 2 - secondary storage
	
	Virtualization support - Run multiple OS on the same hardware
		virtualization used to be software based but as time went on it was added to the cpu hardware
			faster and easier to manage
			Intel Virtualization technology (VT)
			AMD Virtualization (AMD-V)
	
	Hyper-threading technology (HTT) - run multiple data transactions at the same time, CPU acts as multiple CPUs, keeps cpu from being idle.
		Windows XP or later, any modern os
		
	Speed - CPU clock, measured in Mega or Giga hertz
		Actual speed - clock speed, cache size, bus width and speed all factor in
		CPU manufacturing have moved away from cpu clock speed as a measure of performance
			two different 3.2 GHz cpus are not necessarily the same
	
	Overclocking - increasing clock speed past factory, creates more heat and uses more power, can be unstable
		often voids cpu warranty
	
	Integrated GPU - many cpus have graphics integrated, removing the need for a standalone graphics card for basic tasks
	
	AMD tends to be cheaper than Intel while intel is slightly more performative, but this is always changing

**CPU Cooling**
	Case fans - cool air pulled through pc
	
	On-board fans - built onto card - usually on high end gpus, can be bulky
	
	Fan sizes are standard size - 80mm, 120mm, 200mm, connected to fan controller or directly to motherboard
		run at variable speed based on temp
		different noise levels
		
	heat sink - dissipate heat from processor, copper or aluminum alloy, fins/grid transfer heat
		thermal paste creates contact between chip and heat sink
	
	fanless/passive cooling - no noise, no fans, silent
		specialized services like tv set top boxes, saellite receivers
		very controlled functions, low power components
	
	cpu fan - often on top of heat sink for even more cooling
	
	liquid cooling - coolant circulating through computer, good for high end systems
		liquid passes through heat sink and captures heat
		radiator in back of pc that cools down heated liquid for next flow

**Expansion Cards**
	relatively easy to add cards with more functionality, just install card and a driver
	
	motherboards often have onboard video, video cards may have more functions
	
	Sound cards can add support for sound systems
	
	Ethernet / wireless cards provide network functions
	
	USB expansions card with more ports
	
	SSD storage cards, common in servers
	
	eSata cards to plug in hard drives externally
