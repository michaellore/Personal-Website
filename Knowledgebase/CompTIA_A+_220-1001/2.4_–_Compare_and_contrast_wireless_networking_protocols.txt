====== 2.4 â€“ Compare and contrast wireless networking protocols ======
Wireless networking 802.11 managed by IEEE standards committee
	802.11a original, operates in 5Gh range, 54Mb/s
	smaller range than 802.11b
	uncommon today
	20Mhz bandwidth
	
	802.11b also original, 2.4 ghz range, 11Mb/s
	better range than a
	frequency conflict with cordless phones, microwaves, etc
	20 Mhz bandwidth
	
	802.11g upgrade 2 B, 2.4GH, 54Mb/s, back compat with B, 20 Mhz bandwidth
	
	802.11n, update to all, both channels 600Mbit/s, MIMO multiple input/output, multiple antennas for simultaneous traffic, 20 or 40Mhz bandwidth (2 contiguous bonded channels)
	
	802.11ac - upgrades over N, 5Ghz band, much larger set of channels with bonding, eight MIMO streams, 866Mbit, 40 mhz bandwidth for 	802.11n stations, 80 for 802.11ac stations, 160 optional for bonded channels
	
Frequency - 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz 
Channels - groups of frequencies, some channels overlap
Bandwidth - amount of frequency to use, 20, 40, 60, 80 Mhz

RFID - radio-frequency identification - small tags, access badges, pet chips, anything that needs to be tracked.
	radio energy powers the tag, tag sends back the info
NFC builds on RFID for two way comms

Zigbee - Internet of things networking standard, alternative to wifi and bluetooth, longer distance than bluetooth, less power than wifi

Z-Wave - proprietary home networking, internet of things, garage doors, lights, ISM band

Cellular networks separates land into "cells"
	2G - GSM and CDMA, poor data support
	3G - allowed new function, GPS, videos, much more data
	4G and LTE - long term evolution, much faster downloads up to 150 Mbit/s
	LTE-A - even faste,r up to 300Mbit
	5G - significant performance improvements at higher frequencies
