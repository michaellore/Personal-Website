====== 2.6 â€“ Explain common network configuration concepts ======
Ipv4 is the primary protocol, Ipv6 is also becoming popular
ipv4 is 4 bytes long, 32 bits.
4 number separated by a . 0-255
192.168.0.1

IPv6 is 128bit, many many more addresses available.. 16byte, represented in hexadecimal with : separated, leading zeroes can be omitted.
	2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
	first half, 64bits, is known as the netowrok prefix
	last 64 bits are host network address

Ipv4 - every device needs a unique address, 
	subnet mask is used by local device to determine subnet - 255.255.255.0
	default gateway - ip address of router, allows you to communicate outside of local subnet
	dns server must be configured, can configure two
	
DHCP handles assigning IP addresses for all addresses - discover, offer, request, acknowledge
	client sends out a request for an ip address
	dhcp server will offer an ip address
	dhcp server will choose from a set of available ip addresses, meaning the device ip address will sometimes change
	you can set a static ip address on a device by disabling dhcp for that device, or by associating the mac address with a specific ip address, useful for servers, printers, etc.
	if your computer doesnt receive a response from dhcp, you can be assigned a local automatic private ip address (APIPA) 169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254 allowing you to communicate on the subnet but not the internet.

SSL Vpn - secure sockets layer vpn / client to site vpn, remote access vpn
	uses tcp 443, avoids most firewall issues
	no big vpn client
	easy authentication
	can run from a browser or a light client

LAN - local area network, group of devices share the same broadcast domain
	virtual LAN, single switch where devices are logically instead of physically separated

NAT - network address translation
	ipv4 addresses are exhausted, so this use of NAT helps
	Many local devices get their local ips translated into one public one that gets sent out to the internet, and then handles translatingit back into the original source IP
