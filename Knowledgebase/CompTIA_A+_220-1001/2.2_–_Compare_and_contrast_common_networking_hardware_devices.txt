====== 2.2 â€“ Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices ======
Network interface card - fundamental network device, in every device that connects to a network, specific to network type, often built into the motherboard

Repeater - receivers signal, regenerates, and resends it, boosting cooper network or wifi reach

Hub - multiport repeater - goes in one port and repeated to the others, half-duplex, devies don't communicate at the same time, becomes less efficient as network speeds increase

Bridge - makes forwarding decisions for a hub, similar to a modern switch, distributes traffic based on mac address, example of a bridge is a wireless access point

Switch - bridging done in hardware, can support hundreds of devices, based on data link address, mulitlayer switch includes routing function

Unmanaged switch - plug and play, little config, low price point

managed switch - vlan support, interconnect with other switches, traffic prioritzation, redundancy support, external management, packet capturing to analyze traffic

router - forward decisions based on ip address, "layer 3 switches"

wireless access point - not a router, extends wired network to wireless

wireless lan controllers - management of WAPS, "single pane of glass", can be cloud based

firewall - filters traffic by port number or by application, can encrypt your traffic and act as a proxy, some firewalls can be used as a layer 3 device (router)

cable modem - broadband network - data on cable network - docsis - data over cable service interface specification, data, voice, video

DSL modem - uses telephone lines, often assymetric, download faster than upload, must be close to the central office, speeds degrade as you get farther

patch panel - large group of jacks to gather together an offices cables, easily managed and moved, only have to run cables once

power over ethernet - one wire for network and electric, useful to power WAPs in hard to power areas. POE switch usually has it marked on the switch

ethernet over power - often called power-line communication, connects devices not normally connected ot ethernet
