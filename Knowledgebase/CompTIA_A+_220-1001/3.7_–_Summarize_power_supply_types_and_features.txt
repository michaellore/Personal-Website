====== 3.7 â€“ Summarize power supply types and features ======
alwyas disconnect from the power source when wokring on a device, some devices can store charge in capacitors. Respect the electricity.
Computer uses Direct Current DC. Power from wall is AC, the power supply converts it.
	115V AC or 220V AC -> 3.5V DC, 5.5v DC, or 12V DC
Ampere (amp) - the rate of electron flow past a point in one second - diameter of hose the water is flowing through
Voltage (volt, V) - electrical 'pressure', how open the faucet is
Watt (W) - measurement of real power use. Volts * Amps = Watts

Alternating current is constantly reversing direction as it flows through the electrical lines, distributes electricity efficiently over distance
	Frequency is important
	US & Canada - 110 to 120 V, 60Hz
	Europe - 220 to 240 V, 50Hz
	
Direct current moves in one direction with constant voltage

Some power supplies have a switch to choose which type of voltage, many are auto-switching. Do not use the wrong voltage - it will cause damage.

Main motherboard power is a 24 pin connector, provides + 3.3V, +- 5.5V and +- 12V
	older MBs use 20 pin
	you can use a 24 pin connector with a 20 pin connection, some cables allow you to disconnect the 4 extra pins
	
Power supply outputs different voltages for different components
	positive and negative voltage
		voltage is a different in electrical potential, electrical ground is a common reference point
	+12 V for larger components
	+5 - other components, many are now using 3.3V
	+3.3V - M.2, RAM, mb logic circuits
	-12V - integrated LAN, older serial ports
	-5V - ISA adapter cards, not common today

Power supplys are rated by supported Watts - large number for overall watts
	bigger not always better, use what you need
	more expensive, does not speed up computer
	physical size mostly standard

Calculate watts needed by all components - video card usually biggest draw
	good rule of thumb is you should use 50% of supply, so if draw is 425W you should use a 850W supply to be safe
