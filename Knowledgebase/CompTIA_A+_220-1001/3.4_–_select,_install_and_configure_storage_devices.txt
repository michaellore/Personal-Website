====== 3.4 â€“ select, install and configure storage devices ======
Optical formats - small bumps read with a laser beam
	CDROM - 700MB capacity
	DVDROM - 4.7GB on single layer 8.5GB on dual layer
	Blu-ray - 25GB single, 50GB dual
You can write to optical disks, doesn't create bumps but darkens photosensitive dye
	CD-RW - compact disc re-writable
	DVD read and rewritable DVD-R/RW
	BD-R blu ray recordable / BD-RE (erasable)
	
Solid state drive - SSD no movable parts, very fast, no spinning hard drive delay
	Sata  
	M.2 - no sata cable, as fast or faster than sata, PCI Express bus connection, connects with B, M or B and M key
		B key - PCIE x2
		M key - PCIE x4

Hard disk drive - rapid spinning disk, magnetic storage, moving parts can break, platter spends around spinder, actuator arm head reads data

SSHD - solid state hybrid drive, SSD as cache, also has moving parts

USB flash drive - flash memory, EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory), non-volatile, no power needed to keep data. limited number of writes. not designed for archiving

Other flash memory include SD, micro SD, picture cards

You can use an array of drives for data redundancy

RAID - redundant array of independent disks - usually inexpensive disks.
Multiple RAID levels
	RAID 0 - striping
		file blocks split between two or more drives
		data written quickly
		no redundancy, one drive fail breaks array
	
	RAID 1 - mirroring
		file blocks are duplicated across drives
		lots of space used
		one drive failing does not break array
	
	RAID 5 - stirping with parity
		file blocks are stirped along with a parity block
		requires at least 3 disks
		files aren't duplicated but parity block takes up space
		high redundancy, but parity calculation may affect performance
	
	Nested RAID - RAID1+0 (RAID 10) - stirpe of mirrors
		combines raid 0 and raid 1
		need a t least 4 drives, files are striped across drives and then mirrored

Software RAID - built into OS, doesn't require special hardware, usually lower performance than hardware.

Hardware RAID - feature of the hard drive controller, usually invisible to the OS, high performance, designed for speed
Hot swappable - can add and remove drives while system is running
