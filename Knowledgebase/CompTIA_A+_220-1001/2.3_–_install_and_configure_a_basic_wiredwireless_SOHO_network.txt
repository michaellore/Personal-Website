====== 2.3 â€“ install and configure a basic wired / wireless SOHO network ======
SOHO router, small office/home office - all in one device
modem, router, switch, wap, firewall, all in one
provides routing to the outside network, has a switch built in, not much to configure.
Often includes 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequencies and channel bandwidth
Can configure ssid name and security mode, usually WPA2
Automatically assign ip addreses by dhcp

Configuring SOHO firewall
	no external device can directly access internal network
	dmz ports cna be configured to allow access - usually a bad idea
	network address translation can translate all internal devices to a single external address to free up ip addresses
	port forwarding - access a service hosted internally, gaming server, security system
		-external ip/port maps to internal ip/port 
		-destination nat / static nat
	UpnP - universal plug and play - devices can find each other on network - used for peer to peer apps
	whitelist/blacklist - filter ocntent/ip addresses
		whitelist - implicit deny, only added items allowed
		blacklist - items added are not allowed
	mac filtering - media access control "hardware" address
	wireless encryption - wpa2-aes preferred, WEP not preferred
	QoS Quality of service - prioritize traffic, ports, apps
