====== 5.6 â€“ troubleshoot printers ======
Try printing a test page - built into Windows, not the app giving you an issue
Use diagnostic tools on the printe ror in the web-based client

Streaks and blurs
	Inkjet - clean print heads
	Laser - check for scratches on the drum

Faded or blank - replace ink or toner

Ghost images on laser - cleaning process not working very well

Color prints in wrong color - one of your color cartridges might be empty or low

Laser printer smudges - fusing issue, may not be getting hot

Paper jam - be careful - do not rip and pull hard enough to damage internals

Creased paper - check paper path, make sure paper is the correct weight

No network connection  - make sure printer is on and on the correct netowrk

Access denied? - Security tab in printer properties

Garbled characters - wrong driver or wrong page description language (PCL vs PostScript), bad application
	check with a test page

Can't install printer - check driver is for correct OS

Backed up print queue - check print server, restart print spooler service
	check recovery options in print spooler service properties
	
Error codes on printer display
	low memory - printer builds whole page in memory - lots of graphics on page
	
No output - check if printer is on, try to do a test print from the printer itself
	if test on printer works try it from windows
	try to connect directly with usb
	test drivers and network connection
	try from a different application

Corrupted print jobs - print spooler will crash and usually automatically restart, can start looping
	logged in event viewer under windows-printservice
	can be one job causing the issue
