====== 5.2 â€“ troubleshoot problems related to motherboards, RAM, CPUs, and power ======

Unexpected shutdown - no warning black screen
	often a heat-related issue, cpu or gpu
	check your fans and heat sinks
	could be failing hardware
	
Lockups - using system normally then it freezes
	check for any activity, hard drive lights, use CTRL+ALT+DELETE
	any updated drivers or patches?
	Low resources - not enough RAM or storage
	hardware diagnostics might help

POST - power on self test
	tests major hardware componnents - cpu, video, ram
	failures noted with a test of beeps or codes
	
POST and boot - blank screen on boot, sometimes a video problem or bios config
	motherboard bettery may fix datetime errors
	Attempting to boot to incorrect device - check boot order

Continuous reboots
	how far is it getting - BIOS or OS flash screen?
	Bad driver or config - F8 to boot form last known working config
	Start in safe - loads a basic ocnfig
	rmeove or replace bad hardware, check connections

No power - at source or from power supply? use multimeter to check
	some components get power but others don't - bad MB?
	low power supply output - starting fans but not other parts?

Overheating - check cooling systems, cable management, clean and clear

Loud noises - should hum, not grind
	scraping = hard drive problem
	clicking - hard drive or fan
	pop - blown capacitor
	
Intermittent failure - sometimes it works - bad adapter install, reseat. Bad hardware, poor connection

Indicator lights - sometimes POST codes are lights on the mb. Network lights.

Smoke and burning smell - electrical issue, immediately unplug and let cool down

Crash screen - windows stop error, 'blue screen of death'. use the info on screen or in event log to troubleshoot
	shows specific file and error messages 
	
Mac - spinning ball of death - mouse turns into a spinning ball - Spinning wait cursor
	something is holding up the entire OS
	Bug in app, bad hardware, slow paging
	Restart computer, some info may be in logs

Log entries
	Windows
		-Event Viewer
		-Boot Logd - System Configuration
		C:\Windows\ntbtlog.txt
	
	Linux
		individual app logs
		/var/log
	
	MacOs
		-Utilities/Console.app

Always write down error message for documentation even if it doesn't make any sense to you.
