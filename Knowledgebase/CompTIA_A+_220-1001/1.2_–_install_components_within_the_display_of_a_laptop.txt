====== 1.2 â€“ install components within the display of a laptop ======
Most laptops use LCD display, backlight shines thru liquid crystals
	low power, light, inexpensive
	poor black levels, difficult to replace

other displays like OLED - organic light emitting diode - lights up when hit with current
	very flexible and mobile, no backlight
	decay over time, burn-in, more expensive and power hungry

usually multiple antennas in display, wifi and bluetooth wrap around top of screen

usually webcam embedded with video and audio

microphone built in but low quality

LED-backlit LCD display - LEDs around edge of screen or an array behind the screen, most newer laptop

CCFL - cold cathode flourescent lamp - older laptop, higher voltage and power, more thickness

some laptops have inverters to convert dc to ac for lcd displays

some displays are digitizers that let you draw with a stylus or have a touchscreen
