====== 2.1 â€“ Compare and contrast TCP and UDP ports, protocols, and their purposes ======
Moving data can be thought of as moving along a road. The moving truck is the Internet protocol, the road (cables, ethernet, DSL) has been designed for it.
The truck contains data, boxes of TCP and udp. Inside the boxes are your application data.
Client sends ethernet data to the server.
Inside ethernet payload is the ip payload
Inside IP payload is the tcp/udp payload which contains application data such as http data being sent to a web server.
This nesting is called encapsulation. TCP/UDP operates on OSI layer 4, transport layer.

TCP - transmission control protocol, connection-oriented, formal connection start and close, like a phone call
	reliable, error recovery, can retransmit
	flow control, receiver can manage data 

UDP - user datagram protocol, 
	no formal open and close
	unreliable, no error recovery
	no data reordering
	sender controls data flow
	
IP delivery truck delivers from one IP address to another. Each "box" has a room (port) label so the receiver knows which service receives the data

IPv4 sockets - server ip, protocol, server app port, client ip, protocol, client port

non-ephermeral port - permanent port number, 0 through 1023 usually on server or service, like web server on 80

ephemeral ports - temporary - 1024 through 65535 detemrined in real time by client, discarded after session

most servers (services) use non-ephemeral port numbers

port numbers used for communication, not security

client must know which port to use

tcp and udp port numbers are not the same

**__Common Network ports__**
FTP - file transfer tcp/20 active mode data, tcp/21 controls comms
SSH - secure shell tcp/22
telnet - telecommunication network - tcp/23, unencrypted, not used in production
smtp - tcp/25 sending mail
DNS - domain name system, converts names to ip - udp/53
http - browser comes tcp/80, https uses tcp/443
pop3 uses tcp/110
imap uses tcp/143
remote desktop RDP - tcp/3389
smb server message block, windows file and printer sharing - modern direct SMB over tcp/445 does not use netbios
	older devices might use netbios - udp/137 for netbios name services
	udp/138 - netbios datagram service
	tcp/139 netbios session service
Apple Filing protocol - file service in macOS - tcp and udp 548
DHCP - dynamic host configuration - udp 67 and 68 - automated configuration of ip addresses, addresses can be reserved by MAC address
LDAP - lightweight directory access tcp/389 - store and receive info in network
simple network management - queries udp 161 traps over udp 162
