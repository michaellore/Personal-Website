====== 5.4 â€“ troubleshoot video, projector, and display issues ======

No video image - is it connected? check power and cable connection
	check correct input on device - hdmi, vga etc
	try on different computer

image dim - check brightness

No video after windows load - use VGA mode (F8)

Flickering/incorrect color patterns - check cable pins

Distorted image/blurriness - check os resolution and refresh rate settings
	check hardware acceleration - may have to disable
	
Icons too big = resolution too low

Burn-in - image locked in place even when not displayed "ghosting"
	some displays will pixel shift to combat - you won't notice
	some LCDs will have image sticking - fix by displaying pure white for extended period

stuck pixel - constantly bright
dead pixel - always black

artifact - odd or strange graphics, motion trails - check video card settings

BSOD and overheating - check hardware temps
