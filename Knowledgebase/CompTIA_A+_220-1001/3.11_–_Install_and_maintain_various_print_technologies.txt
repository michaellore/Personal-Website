====== 3.11 â€“ Install and maintain various print technologies ======
**Laser printer** - combines a laser, high voltage. ions, powdered ink, and heat. prints fast and high quality. very complex, many moving parts, has memory on-board, can be more expensive
	imaging drum - image is drawn onto photosensitive drum 'painted with the laser', then picks up toner to transfer to page
		can be separate or combined into toner cartridge
	user heat and pressure to melt and bind toner to page
	cyan, magenta, yellow, black - four separate cartridges
	pickup roller, picks up the paper one page at a time
		should be cleaned to prevent jams
	separation pad - helps pick up only the top sheet of paper
	duplex - prints one side, then turns paper around to print the other

	Laser printing process:
		job is processed into memory
		charging photosensitive drum with negative ions - primary charging roller
		exposing by laser to write out the image that should appear on page
		developing toner from the cartridges to the areas of the drum that are marked out
		transfer toner from drum to passing paper
		use heat and pressure to fuse toner to paper - this is why printed papers are warm
		clean leftover toner off of drum to make ready for next print job

	**Laser printer maintenance**
	replacing the toner - look for messages - low does not mean empty
	toner may also contain the OPC drum- organic photoconductor drum
		sensitive to light, keep it in the bag
	power off and disconnect the printer before working
	
	most manufactures provide a maintenance kit with common parts.
	maintenance is based on page print count
	after maintenance, reset the page counter
	
	after replacing toner, you can calibrate for better output, might be automated or manual
	
	laser printers get dusty, manufacturers recommend different cleaning methods
		use damp cloth, isopropyl alcohol to clean rollers

**Inkjet printers **- ink-dispersion, relatively inexpensive, very quiet. Ink is expensive and proprietary. ink can fade over time and can clog.
	Ink cartridges drop the ink onto the page
	CMYK - cyan magenta yellow, key (black)
	some cartridges integrate the print head, sometimes they are separate
	use a feed roller to pull paper through printer
	some can do duplexing
	Ink cartridges move back and forth across page along a belt
	sometimes cartridges may need to be calibrated and realigned
	
	**Inkjet Maintenance**
	clogged print heads is a big issue - streaky, missing colors. cleaning is automatic or can be started manually
	sometimes print heads can be removed for cleaning
	when cartridges are empty they must be rpelaced, sometimes 4 different, sometimes just color and black
		after replacement the printer will calibrate
	paper can jam, remove jam fromt he path - be firm, but don't rip
	
**Thermal printers** - no ink or toner - special paper is sent through the printer that turns black when heated.
	often used for receipts
	very quiet, almost silent
	paper is very sensitive to light and heat
	paper fades over time
	similar feed to an inkjet printer - paper is feed through by a roller
	uses a heating element - there is no moving print head
	
	**Thermal printer maintenance**
	exact paper must be used - pretty cheap but you have to use the right paper
	heating element can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol
	usually not much debris
	you can use compressed air but should avoid a vacuum
	
**Impact printers** - aka Dot Matrix - print head with a pin matrix presses against a ribbon to mark the paper
	good for carbon/multiple copies
	low cost per page
	noisy from the impact of pins hitting paper
	poor quality output resolution - not good for images
	useful in places like airports and car rentals where multple copies need to be made
	print head moves back and forth to make pins hit ribbon and paper
	one long ribbon that is easy to replace
		proprietary size specific to printer model
	use a tractor feed - paper is pulled through with holes on side of paper - continuous feed, perforations between pages
	
	**Impact printer maintenance**
	one single self contained ribbon that can be replaced
		replace when ink becomes too light
		designed to be modular - but specific to printer model
	print head takes a lot of abuse from impact - may need replacing eventually
		gets hot, be careful
		modular, look for a release lever or bar
		good time to replace the ribbon too
	paper must feed perfectly into the holes
	forms must be positioned exactly to make text fit the predefined space
	very long sheet of paper must feed continuously, so look out for obstruction

**Virtual printers** - no physical output, prints to a 'digital document'
	no physical printer, ink, paper
	good for sending docs electronically
	'print to file' option in print dialog
		prints to file type specific to the printer you have selected
		then when you are at the printer you can copy that file to the printer
			command line - copy filename LPT:
	
	Print to PDF - prints to standard pdf, proprietary to Adobe but almost all ocmputers have software to read them, built into many browsers
		Virtual pdf printer shows up as a different printer in Windows that you can configure
	
	Print to XPS - similar to print to PDF, but Microsoft XPS format, XML paper specification
	
	Print to image - prints to an image for editing or viewing in any image application
		not commonly integrated in os, just specific applications

**3D printers** - creates a physical 3D item based on an electronic model file.
	melt plastic filament by layers to create the object
	rapid prototyping
	designs are electronic and can be sent anywhere
