====== 4.2 â€“ set up and configure client-side virtualization ======
One computer running many operating systems

Each VM has all its own resources, independent. host-based - your normal desktop + others

At enterprise level, it's common to have one single large server running many VMs

Hypervisor - software that manages the VMs - Virtual Machine Manager
	may require a supporting CPU
	Intel  - VT
	AMD - AMD-V
	need enough memory to support all if you are running multiple VMs

Virtualization is a native operating system, performing native OS processes

Emulation is one device running processes designed for a different architecture
	one device is pretending to be another
	original code used, but software interprets it to run the code 
	slower than virtualization

Hypervisor is a key security point.
	VM escaping - malware realizes it is on a VM, compromises the hypervisor to get to other VMs
	malware on one server can get info from another
	very rare

Every guest is self-contained, normal security controls should be used like any other computer.

Most VM managers have their own virtual internal networks
	shared network address - VM has same IP as physical host
	Uses a private IP internally
	uses NAT to convert to the physical host IP
	
Bridged network address - VM is a device on the physical network

Private address - VM does not communicate outside of the virtual network
