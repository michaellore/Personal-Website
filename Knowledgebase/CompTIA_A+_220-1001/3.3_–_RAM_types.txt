====== 3.3 â€“ RAM types ======
RAM - random access memory, most common but not only type of memory
Data and programs are used when moved to ram, very important component

DIMM - dual in line memory module
	SO-DIMM - small outline, usually in laptops, about half the size
	
DRAM - dynamic random access, memory on the dimm, needs constant refreshing, any storage location access directly

SDRAM - synchronous DRAM, synced with common system clock of pc, can queue up processes

SDR vs DDR - single vs double data rate
	DDR2 - twice as fast as DDR, not backwards compat
	DDR3 - twice rate of DDR - 16GB per dimm, not backwards compat
	DDR4 - can be 64GB per DIMM, not backwards compat
	newer DDR cannot fit into older slots
	
Multi-channel memory - dual, triple, and quad channel - performanc eincrease by installing multiple modules vs one large one
	memory combos should match, exact match is best
	often color coded
	
parity memory - adds a parity bit, can determine when errors occur but not correct them
	even parity - the bit makes an even number

error correcting code (ECC) - detects and corrects errors on the fly
