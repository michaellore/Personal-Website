====== Filesystems ======
See:[[:knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Windows:Filesystems| Filesystems for Windows]]

Instructs the os in how to organize files.

ex4 is the default Linux filesystem.

Linux has several tools for disk management.
	* Parted - interactive and command line modes
		* __parted -l__ - lists disks, with partitions, size, filesystem etc
		* __sudo parted /dev/sdb__ - launches parted tool for this disk
		* mkpart command - partition a disk
			* __mkpart <partition type> <filesystem> start size__
			* {{.\pasted_image.png}}
		* mkfs command - format a partition
			* __sudo mkfs -t <type> <partition>__
			* {{.\pasted_image001.png}}
			* {{.\pasted_image002.png}}

Filesystems must be mounted to a directory
	* __sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /my_usb/__
	* __sudo umount my_usb__ or __sudo umount /dev/sdb1__
	* manually mounted disks are unmounted on shutdown

Permanently mount devices in __/etc/fstab__:
	* UUID of usb drive - get with __sudo blkid__

Dedicated area of hard drive for virtual memory is swap space. Can partition swap space with __parted__ tool.
	* __mkpart primary linux-swap 5GiB 100% __- 100% for rest of space
		* __mkswap /dev/sdb2/__
			* __sudo swapon /dev/sbd2/__
	* can automatically add swap space by adding to the __/etc/fstab__ file.

Metadata and files are orgnanized into a structure called an inode in an inode table, similar to Windows MFT. 
	* Softlinks work similar to symbolic links in windows - point to another file
		* __ln -s <file> <softlink>__
		* {{.\pasted_image003.png}}
	* Hardlinks point to an inode, similar to windows
		* __ln <file><hardlink>__
		* {{.\pasted_image004.png}}

See disk usage with __du -h__ command, shows disk usage of a directory. __df -h__ command shows amount of free space. Linux does not really need defragmentation.

Repair file system in linux with __fsck__ command - make sure file system is not mounted
	* __sudo fsck /dev/sda__
	* if you run it on a mounted system there is a chance it will damage the filesystem
	* fsck runs on boot in some distros to check for and fix errors
