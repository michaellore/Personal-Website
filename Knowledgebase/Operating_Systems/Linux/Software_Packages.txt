====== Software Packages ======
See: [[:Knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Windows:Software Packages|Software Packages in Windows]]

Different Linux distributions can have different package types. Ubuntu uses Debian, .deb files.

Installing a standalone debian package - dpkg command, i flag for install, r for remove, does not automatically install dependencies
	* __sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb__
	* __sudo dpkg -r atom-amd64.deb__
Can use __grep __command to search if a package is installed:
	* __dpkg -l | grep atom __- pipe sends output of dpkg -l and sends it to input of grep

You can also use 7-zip with linux:
	* __7z -e <file to extract>__
Can also use the __tar__ command that is included with most distros
	* [[http://www.linfo.org/tar.html|More info on tar command]]

Use package managers to install dependencies for programs - apt Advanced Package Tool
	* __sudo apt install gimp__
	* __sudo apt remove gimp__
	* Package sources and links are listed in the __/etc/apt/sources.list__ file
	* There are also other repositories called personal package archives - PPAs
		* Hosted on Launchpad servers, allows open source devs to develop, maintain, and distribute software

Update packages:
	* __apt update__ - gets list of applicable updates
	* __apt upgrade__ - installs the updates

In linux, everything is considered a file, even hardware. When you plug a device in, a file is created in /dev/
	* Character devices like keyboard and mouse, transmit data character by character
	* Block devices, like usb drives, hard drives, CDs transfer blocks of data
	* /dev/sda - sd is a mass storage device, 'a' or 'b' is the order they are detected by computer
	* In __ls -la__ output, the first bit is the type
		* d for directory
		* c for character device
		* b for block device
		* {{.\pasted_image.png}}

Device drivers are sometimes built into the kernel, but if not you can install a kernel module which extends kernel functionality for your device.

In Linux you update the kernel as if it is any other package.
	* __uname -r__ - see kernel version
	* __sudo apt update__ - update application sources
	* __sudo apt full-upgrade__ - update kernel, will install new packages or uninstall if needed, use caution
