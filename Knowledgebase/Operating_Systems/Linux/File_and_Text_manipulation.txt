====== File and Text manipulation ======

* __cat <file>__ - view contents of document
* __less <file>__- similar to windows **more **- better functionality than cat
	* g key - move to beginning of file
	* G - moves to end of file
	* /word_search - search for word or phrase
	* q - quit less, go back to shell
* __head <file>__ - first 10 lines of file
* __tail <file>__ last 10 lines

Editing files - many test editors
	* nano <file>, opens in nano, commands at bottom. ^G = Ctrl + G
	* vim
	* emacs

Search for file name or word in file:
	* __grep <term> <file name>__
	* __grep <term> *.txt__

Same 3 output streams as in [[:Knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Windows:Powershell commands|Windows.]]
	* __echo woof > dog.txt__ - redirects text 'woof' into a file dog.txt
	* __echo woof >> dog.txt__ - appends text instead
	* __<__ to get input from a file instead of keyboard
		* cat < file_input.txt
	* __2>__ to redirect stderr into a file
		* ls /dir/fake_dir 2> error_output.txt
	* can also filter out error messages by sending to /dev/null
		* __less /var/log/syslog 2> /dev/null__

	* pipe | to redirect input - search for 'bluetooth' in /etc directory
		* __ls -la /etc | grep bluetooth__
