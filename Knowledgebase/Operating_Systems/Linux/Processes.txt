====== Processes ======
See: [[:Knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Windows:Processes|Processes in Windows]]

Processes have a parent-child relationship. Initial process is init, which has a process id (PID) of 1. Init starts other startup processes.

Find process info with __ps__ .
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html

Can pipe input from ps into grep to search for process.

Linux has many signals that can be sent to processes, including SIGINT, sent with CTRL+C.

Terminate process with the __kill__ command, which sends a SIGTERM.

Check system resource utilization with __top__ command. __uptime__ command shows some system info. __lsof__ command lists open files with what processes are using them.
