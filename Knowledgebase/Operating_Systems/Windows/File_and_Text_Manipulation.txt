====== File and Text Manipulation ======

* cat - view contents of file - cat myfile.txt
	* -Head - show first 10 lines
	* -Tail - show last 10 lines
* more - view contents, but pauses when terminal window is filled
	* enter - advance file by one line
	* space - advance by one page (fill terminal window)
	* q key - quit more, go back to shell
* start <file editor> <file name> - open file in editor - start notepad myfile.txt

Searching within files:
	* Windows search service - gui option, but indexing takes a long time
		* Search for "indexing"
	* Powershell - SLS - Select-String <search term / pattern / regex> <file> - Select-String cow myfile.txt
		* Multiple files, use Wildcard * instead of specific file

Searching directories:
	* -Recurse to list, -Filter to filter results for a pattern. 
		* ls 'C:\Program Files' -Recurse -Filter *.exe will show all matching .exe files
