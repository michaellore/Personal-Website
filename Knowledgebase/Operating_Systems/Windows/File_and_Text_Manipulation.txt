* __cat__ - view contents of file - __cat myfile.txt__
	* __-Head__ - show first 10 lines
	* __-Tail__ - show last 10 lines

	* space - advance by one page (fill terminal window)
	* q key - quit more, go back to shell
* start <file editor> <file name> - open file in editor - __start notepad myfile.txt__

Searching within files:
	* Windows search service - gui option, but indexing takes a long time
		* Search for "indexing"
	* Powershell - SLS - Select-String <search term / pattern / regex> <file> - __Select-String cow myfile.txt__
		* Multiple files, use Wildcard * instead of specific file

Searching directories:
	* -Recurse to list, -Filter to filter results for a pattern. 
		* __ls 'C:\Program Files' -Recurse -Filter *.exe__ will show all matching .exe files
