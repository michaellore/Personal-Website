====== Processes ======
See: [[:Knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Linux:Processes|Processes in Linux]]

Programs are applications like Chrome. Processes are programs that are running, you cna have lots of processes for the same program - many Chrome windows.

All processes are assigned a unique process ID, PID.

Background/daemon processes run in the background, like logging and network processes.

First user mode process is the Session Manager Subsystem, whih kicks off the login process, winlogin.exe, and the Clent/Server runtime subsystem, csrss.exe, which starts the GUI.

Stop a process in command line with __taskkill__.

Each process has a parent that it inherits some attributes and variables from, but processes can operate independently.

Find process info in Task Manager. Find the PID of a process in the Details tab.
	* In CMD - use __tasklist__
	* In Powershell, use __Get-Process__

A signal is used to tell a process that something has happened. A common signal is SIGINT, sent with CTRL+C in command line, to interrupt the process.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/signal?view=msvc-160

A tool to manage processes is the Process Explorer that gives many more details about processes, including files it is active on, parent processes, and suspending, killing, and restarting.

Monitor how many resources a process is using with the Resource Monitor.
	* In Powershell, use __Get-Process__
	* __Get-Process | Sort CPU -descending | Select -first 3 -Property ID, ProcessName, CPU__ - shows top 3 processes by CPU usage
