====== Powershell commands ======
Commands listed on the [[Basic CLI Commands]] page are Aliases for actual Powershell commands. To see an alias, use: Get-Alias <command>
Command.exe (CMD) commands also use aliases.

__Get-alias ls__ -> __Get-ChildItem__
__Get-ChildItem__ = ls = dir
	* __Get-ChildItem C:\__ gives same output as **ls = **same as** dir**

Help command for CMD = /?
	* Get-Help ls = dir /?

Windows has 3 I/O streams, __stdin, stdout, stderr__ - standard in, out, error
	* User provides input into the stdin stream
	* process communicates back to you by putting data in stdout stream and CLI writes it onscreen
	* 1 = stdout
	* 2 = stderr

Writing files:
	* __echo__ = Write-Output, prints to screen
	* __>__ is a redirect operator, allows sending stdout to a file instead of the screen. 
		* __echo woof > dog.txt__ will create or overwrite a file "dog.txt" with text 'woof'
		* __echo woof >> dog.txt__ will instead append the text
		* __Get-Help about_redirection__ for more info

	* can pass output of one command into input of another with pipe |
		* __cat words.txt | Select-String st__
			* will pass contents of a words.txt file and search it for the string 'st'

		* __cat words.txt | Select-String st > st_words.txt__
			* perform the same search, but write the output to a st_words.txt file

	* can also redirect stderr output into a file. ex - rm my_secure_file outputs insufficient permission error text
		* __rm my_secure_file 2> error.txt__ instead outputs this text into a file, error..txt
			* 2 is for the output stream, stderr

		* if we don't care about error msg, can redirect to null
			* __rm my_secure_file 2> $null__
