====== Software Packages ======
See: [[:Knowledgebase:Operating Systems:Linux:Software Packages|Software Packages in Linux]]

Software is usually packaged in a .exe executable file that contains instructions for the computer to run. Created according to Microsofts portable executable PE format.

Portable executable includes text, images, sometimes an MSI file - Microsoft install package, guides the Installer in the installation, maintenance, and removal of programs. If there's no MSI file, the exe will contain all instructions for installation.

Windows Store is a repository for universal windows platform apps than can run on any compatible Windows device, use a format called appx.

You can run an executable from the command line by navigating to the directory with an executable, and type its name.

Oftentimes files and installers are stored in archive files - .zip, .tar, .rar, which must be extracted before they can be used. Archives can be extracted using programs like 7-zip or Winrar. Archives make it easier to send many files at once.

You can add files to an archive in powershell:
	* __Compress-Archive -Path <path to files> <Path to archive>__
Extract:
	* __Expand-Archive -Path <path to archive> -DestinationPath <path to extract to>__

Software packages often require other software or pieces of code to work correctly - dependencies - a game may need an outside rendering library.
	* In Windows, shared libraries are called Dynamic Link Libraries, .dll files
	* The same DLL can be used by many different programs
	* Shared libraries are managed by side-by-side assemblies, SxS, stored at C:|Windows\WinSxS
		* Programs list their required libraries in a manifest

You can use Powershell to find software along with its dependencies, __Find-Package__ cmdlet
	* __Find-Package sysinternals -IncludeDependencies __- lists the package to install with dependencies

Can use package managers like Chocolatey to install from the command line
	* __Install-Package -Name sysinternals__

Windows groups all devices and drivers together in Device Manager.
	* automatically installs new plugged-in devices with the Plug-n-Play system

Windows Update client service runs in the background to download and install OS updates.
	* Windows 10 uses cumulative updates, theoretically saving space instead of having to install hundreds of updates
		* Downside is that updates aren't optional
