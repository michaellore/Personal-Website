====== TCP/IP Model ======

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Bottom layer - physical layer cables, specs describe how signals are sent

2nd - data link layer (or network access layer) - introduces protocols, defines way of interpreting signals to communicate (ethernet, wifi)

3rd -  network layer - delivers data across a collection of networks (IP - internet protocol)

4th - transport - sorts out which clients and servers get data (tcp - transmission control protocol, udp - user datagram protocol)

5th - Application - protocols are application specific, "contents of package"
