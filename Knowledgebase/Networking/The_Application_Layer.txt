====== The Application Layer ======
TCP segment data payload is the contents of whatever data the applications send one another. contents of a web page, streaming video, etc
many different protocols in use, standardized by type. for example, all web browsers and servers communicate using the same http protocol.

In the [[:Knowledgebase:Networking:OSI Model|OSI model]], 5th layer is the session layer. Facilitates comms between actual applications and transport layer.
	6th layer - presentation layer - repsonsible for making sure unencapsulated application layer data is able to be understood by application in question
