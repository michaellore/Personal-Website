====== The Data Link Layer ======

The data link layer abstracts away the need for higher layers to care about specific hardware so they can operate device-agnostically.

Ethernet solves collision domain with "carrier sense multiple access with collision detection" (CSMA/CD). Determines when comms channels are clear and device can transmit. Senses when data is being sent both ways and waits a random interval of time before sending again to prevent collisions

MAC address (media access control) is a global unique identifier - 48-bit (6 byte) number represented by 6 hexadecimal groupings of 2 numbers
	* first 3 octets are Organizationally Unique identifier (OUI) -  assigned to individual hardware manufacturers
	* last 3 octets assigned freely as long as they are unique

Ethernet uses MAC address to keep data sent correctly


Unicast transmission - meant for only one destination. looks for special bit in destination MAC - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero. sent to all devices on collision domain, only processed by recepient

Multicast - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one. sent to all devices on collision domain, accepted or rejected based on criteria. Network interfaces can be configured to accept multicast addresses

Broadcast - sent to every device on the LAN using a broadcast address. All Fs


Data packet - any set of binary data sent across network link
	* at ethernet level, known as ethernet frame - highly structured, presented in specific order
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
preamble - 8bytes (64 bits), can be split into two sections
	* first 7 bytes act as a buffer between frames and can synchronize internal clocks to regulate speed
	* last byte is SFD start frame delimiter - signals to receiver preamble is over, actual contents follow

Destination address & Source - MAC addresses of receiver and sender

Ether-type - 16-bits, describes protocol of frame contents

VLAN header - not always present, indicates frame is a VLAN frame. Virtual LAN - multiple logical LANs on the same physical equipment, often used to segregate traffic. Ex - phones on one, desktops on another

Payload - the actual data

Frame Check Sequence - 4byte (32 bit) number that is a checksum for entire frame. Calculated by performing a cyclical redundancy check against frame (CRC)
	* CRC - verifies integrity of data. if receiving checksum is not the same as sender, data is thrown out. Highler layers determines retransmission
