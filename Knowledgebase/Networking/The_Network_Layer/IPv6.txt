starting to be more common because we are out of ipv4 addresses. 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal numbers

2001:0db8 are reserved ips for documentation and education.
Can shorten an ipv6 address by removing leading zeroes
Any number of consecutive groups of just zeroes can be replaced by two colons ::, can happen once for any specific address

Ipv6 header
{{.\pasted_image004.png}}
* version - what version of ip is in use
* traffic class - type of traffic, different classes of traffic get different priorities
* flow label - routers make decisions about quality of service level
* payload length - how long data payload section is
* next header - defines type of next immeidate header
* hop limit - identical to TTL

Ipv4 mapped address space - space reserved for addresses that directly correlate to existing ipv4 addresses

Ipv6 tunnels - take incoming ipv6 taffic and encapsulate it within ipv4 datagrams
	* tunnel broker - company provides ipv6 endpoints so you don't need additional equipment on your network
