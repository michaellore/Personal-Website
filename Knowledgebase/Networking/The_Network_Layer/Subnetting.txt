====== Subnetting ======
process of taking large networkings and splitting them into many smaller subnetworkets - subnets
incorrect subnetting setups are a common issue

Gateway router serves as the entry and exit point of a network
core internet routers only speak to other core routers

when a packet gets to a gateway router, that router is responsible for data. subnets all have their own gateway router

subnet id - defines subnet - calculated via subnet mask, a 32 bit number written out as 4 octets

subnet mask tells us what we can ignore when computing host ID, zeroes tell us what we can keep
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
In this case, we know that only the last octet is available for host IDs. subnet can usually contain 2 less than the total number of host IDs available.

another subnet mask:

27 ones, 5 zeroes. This means we have 5 bits of host ID space, for a total of 32 addresses.

Example - 9.100.100.100 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224. Since that subnet mask represents 27 ones followed by 5 zeros, a quicker way of referencing this is with the notation /27. The entire IP and subnet mask can be written now as 9.100.100.100/27

Binary Math- base 2
{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
8-bit = 2^8 = 256 (0-255)
16-bit = 2^16 (0-65535)
1 = true, 0 = false

CIDR - classless inter-domain routing, expands subnetting by demarcating networks. network and subnet ID are combined. allows for more arbitrary network sizes
