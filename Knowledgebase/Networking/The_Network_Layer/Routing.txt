====== Routing ======
router forwards traffic, has at least 2 network addresses
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
Router has an interface on each network it is in.

Router inspects ip datagram header for destination IP then looks at routing table. creates a new ip datagram by duplicating the old, decrementing TTL by 1, and sets new source and destination MAC.

core internet routers are often connected in a mesh - many different paths for packet to take

routing table - basic setup - 4 columns
	* destination network - row for each network the router knows about
	* next hop - ip address of next router that should receive data
	* total hops - best path to take
	* interface - which interface router should forward traffic matching destination network out of


interior gateway protocol - share info within a single autonomous system - collection of networks under control of single network operator, like a large corp with many offices
	* link state routing protocols and distance-vector protocols
		* distance-vector - older, sends routing table list (vector) to every other directly connected router, doesn't know much about outside routers
		* link state - each router advertises state of the link of each interface, runs algorithms to determine best path

exterior gateway protocol - share info within independent autonomous systems
	* Border gateway protocol BGP - only currently used standard

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) non-profit helps manage IP address allocation, and autonomous system number (ASN), numbers assigned to individual autonomous systems

Non-routable address space - IP addresses set aside for anyone that cannot be routed to, no gateway router will attempt to forward traffic
	* 3 ranges defined as non-routable by RFC 1918 - 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
		* appropriate for use within autonomous system, external gateway will not route
