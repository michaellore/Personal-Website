====== Name Resolution ======
dns - domain name system, global distributed network services that resolves strings of IP addresses into letters, EX - 184.29.131.121 - weather.com

domain name - term for something that can be resolved by dns. lets administrative changes happen without effecting end user

Data transmits quicker when physsically closer, DNS lets orginations decide which ip address that domains resolve to. Ex - new york user = new york data server

5 types of DNS servers:
	* caching name server - purpose is to store domain name lookup for period of time, most are also recursive
	* recursive name server - perform full dns resolution request
	* root name server
	* TLD name server
	* authoritative name server
any DNS server can fulfill many roles at once
strict heirarchal system for accurate lookups, security against malware traffic redirects

all domain names in dns system have a TTL time to live, value in seconds configured by owner of domain name for how long a name server can cache entry before it is discarded

Anycast - techinque to route traffic to different destinations based on factors like location, congestion, link health
TLD - top level domain, last part of any domain

DNS uses UDP, far less packets than tcp, 8 packets vs 44. DNS over tcp does exist as web has gotten more complex as not all lookup responses can fit in udp diagram

resource record types - many types allow for different types of resolutions
	* A record - used to point to a certain domain name at a certain ipv4 address
		* single domain can have multiple A records - dns round robin - balance traffic across IPs, iterate over lists one by one
	* AAAA (quad A) record - returns an ipv6 address instead of ipv4
	* CNAME (canonical name) record - redirects traffic from one domain to another ex - making microsoft.com resolve to www.microsoft.com
	* MX (mail exchange) record - used to deliver email to correct server
	* SRV (service) record - defines location of specific services, similar to mx but for many service types (CalDEV)
	* TXT (text) record - communicates config preferences about network services

Domain names have 3 parts:

www.google.com

last part - .com - is the top-level domain TLD - many vanity TLDs are available now, handled by ICANN, internet corp for assigned names and numbers
middle - google - domain - demarcates where control moves from tld name server to authoritative name server
first - www - (subdomain/host name)

All together- fully qualified domain name (FQDN). DNS can handle up to 127 levels. Each section can only be 63 characters and complete FQDN can be 255

registrar - company with an agreement with ICANN to sell unregistered domains

DNS zone- hierarchal concepts, allow for easier control over multiple levels of a domain. 
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
zones configured with zone files - simple config file declaring all resource records for a zone
SOA - start of authority - declares zone and name of name server that is authoritative for it
NS record - other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone

Reverse lookup zone file - let dns resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associated with it
	same as zone file, but instead have Pointer resource record (PTR) - resolves ip to a name
