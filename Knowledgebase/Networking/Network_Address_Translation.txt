====== Network Address Translation ======
NAT is a technique, not a defined standard.

Takes one ip address and translates it into another. 
Allows a gateway (router or firewall) to rewrite source ip of an outgoing ip datagram while retaining original IP to rewrite it into the response

NAT hides ip of computer 1 from computer 2 - IP masquerading - no one can establish connection to your computer if they don't know its IP

in our example, you could have hundreds of computers on network A with entire address space protected and invisible. One-to-many NAT.

port preservation - source port chosen by client is the same port used by the router

port forwarding - specific destination ports can be configured to always be delivered to specific nodes

IANA assigns address blocks to the 5 regional internet registries RIRs
	* AFRINIC - africa
	* ARIN - US, CAN, parts of Caribbean
	* APNIC - Asia, Aus, NZ, pacific islands
	* LACNIC - central and south america, other parts of caribbean
	* RIPE - Euro, russia, middle east, parts of central asia
