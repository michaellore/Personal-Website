====== WANs and Wireless Networks ======
WAN - wide area network, acts like a single network, spans across multiple physical locations. contract with ISP to send data across network

point-to-point vpn or site-to-site vpn - vpn tunnel between two sites, cheaper than WAN technology. Many companies don't need WAN tech anymore because many services like email are often handled in the cloud through a third-party

many devices now use wireless networking.
wireless standards defined by IEEE 802.11 standards - make up WiFi tech
frequency band - section of radio spectrum agreed upon to be used for certain communications - In NA FM radio operates between 88 and 108 MHz
Wifi most commonly operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 Ghz. 5 GHz generally faster but has less range. 2.4GHz more susceptible to interference but have more range.

Multiple specs for 802.11:
	* 802.11b
	* 802.11a
	* 802.11g
	* 802.11n
	* 802.11ac
	* each newer verisons has seen some improvement in speed, etc

* Ad-hoc network - all nodes speak to each other directly, no supporting network infrastructure
	* some smartphones can share photos with nearby phones, sometimes used in warehouse settings
	* useful in disaster situations when network infrastructure is knocked out 

* Wireless LAN - WLAN - one or more access points act as a bridge

* Mesh - hybrid between the two, most mesh networks are groups of wireless access points still connected to wired network, lets you add more wireless access points without running cables to each

wireless channels - individual, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network. help address collision domains

Wireless network security - wireless networks not inherently private like wired, no cables just radio waves, anyone could listen in
	* WEP wireless equivalent privacy - very low level privacy, should be seen as sending unencrypted data over a wired connection. 40bit encryption key
	* WPA wifi protected access - 128 bit key, harder to crack
	* WPA2 - 256 bit key, even harder to crack
	* Mac filtering - configure access point to only allow connections from a specific set of MAC addresses
cell networks also operate over radio frequencies. built around the concept of cells - each cell has a specific frequency band. cell towers are like access points
airplane mode disables all networking services

metered connection - limit on data
