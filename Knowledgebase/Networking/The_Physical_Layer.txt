====== The Physical Layer ======

Devices and means of transmitting bits across networks.

modulation -  varying voltage of charge moving across cable
	* line coding - allows devices on either end of link to understand charge

Most common cabling is twisted pair. 
Duplex communication - info flows in both direction, reserves pairs for communicating for simultaneous comms (full-duplex). in an error, half-duplex means only one device communicates at a time

Simplex - only one way

Ethernet over twisted pair - comms protocol that determines how much data can be sent over a cable, how quickly, and how long the cable can be before data quality degrades. See more info on Wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair

Twisted pair cables temrinate at an endpoint where they are exposed in a plug. Most common is RJ45 (registered jack 45)
most ports have 2 LEDs, link and activity.

Sometimes network ports are in a wall, whichare connected to a patch panel. Patch panels contains many ports, and connects to a switch or routers
