====== Devices ======

**Cables** - transmit datas, point-to-point connections
	* Copper - most common, pairs of copper wires in plastic, changes voltages to send data
		* Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 - different categories for different phyical, determine how fast data is sent
			* Cat5 produces crosstalk, accidental detection of pulses by a wire on other wires
			* Higher quality (cat5e, cat6) can re-transmit data
			* Cat6 has different internal arrangement, shorter max distance

	* Fiber - cables are individual optical fibers made of glass, uses pulses of light
		* generally faster than copper and greater distance, but much more expensive


Hubs and switches connect devices on a LAN.

**Hubs **- allows connections from many devices at once, "layer 1 physical device"
	* each connected system determines if data was meant for them
		* causes noise, collision domain where only one device can communicate at once
			* forces a waiting period slowing down network

**Switches** - similar to hubs but are a layer 2 "data link" device 
	* can inspect data to determine what system it is for and only send it to that system
		* eliminates collision domains, fewer re-transmissions

**Routers -** can forward data to indepent networks, a level 3 "network layer" device
	* store tables containing info about how to route traffic
	* home or small business, takes traffic and forwards it to ISP where a core router takes over
		* core router connects to many other routers
		* routers share data via BGP - border gateway protocol - learn most optimal path to forward traffic

**Servers** provide data to requesting devices. The device receiving data is the **client**. Devices on a network are **nodes**. Apllications can also be clients and servers or both.
