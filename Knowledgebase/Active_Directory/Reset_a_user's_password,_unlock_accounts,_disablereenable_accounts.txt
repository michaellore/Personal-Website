====== Reset a user's password, unlock accounts, disable/re-enable accounts ======

Companies often have a policy to lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. There are several options for getting the user back online depending on context.

If the user remembers their password and was simply making a typo:
	* Double click the user in AD Users and Computers
	* Select the Account tab
	* Check the "Unlock Account" box and press Apply.

If the user does not remember their password:
	* Find the user in AD Users and Computers
	* Right click on the user and select "Reset Password"
	* Set the password to a company standard default password
	* Check the box forcing the user to change their password at next log in
	* If the user has also exceeded the max number of failed attempts, check the box to unlock the user account
	* Instruct the user to log in with the default password, and to choose their own new password when prompted

If the user account is disabled (such as after a long period of absence):
	* Find the user in AD Users and Computers
	* Right click the user and choose Enable account
If the user account is expired:
	* Double click the userin AD Users and Computers
	* Select the Account tab
	* At the bottom of the tab, in the Account Expires section, select Never
		* Or select a more appropriate expiration date for the specific user
