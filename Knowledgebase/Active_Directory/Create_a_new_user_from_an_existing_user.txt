====== Create user from an existing user ======

Sometimes you want to create a new user with the same permissions/options as an existing user. 
	* Open AD Users and Computers from Server Manager -> Tools or Start Menu -> Windows Administrative Tools
	* Select the user you want to make a copy of.
	* Right click and select Copy
	* Fill in the new user account details

This user will have the exact same permissions / be a member of the same groups as the original user.

To check user details on the command line, run the command:

	net user <username> /domain
