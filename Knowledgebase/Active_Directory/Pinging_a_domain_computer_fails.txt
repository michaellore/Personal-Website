====== Pinging a domain computer fails ======

Ping is a useful command line utility to test the connection to another computer or domain. If you are trying to ping a domain computer from the server and the request is timing out, it may be because of firewall rules on the domain computer.

Try these steps:

	* On the domain computer, open up the Advanced Firewall Settings
	* You will be prompted to log into an admin account
	* Select "Inbound Rules" in the left panel
	* Scroll down the list until you find the rule for "Echo Request - ICMPv4-In" - ICMP is the protocol that ping uses
		* On the VM, this rule is Virtual Machine Monitoring (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)
	* On the right panel, select "Enable Rule"
	* Try to ping again from the server
