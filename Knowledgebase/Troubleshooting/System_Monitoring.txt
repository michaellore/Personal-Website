====== System Monitoring ======
In Windows, events are logged in the Event Viewer. Use custom views to filter info you are looking for, like only looking for error events within the last hour.

Logs in Linux are stored in __/var/log. __Systems clean out old log files uses log rotation. Sometimes timestaps in Linux are long strings of numbers - Unix or Epoch time.

Effective use of logs:
	* Search for terms like "error"
	* Search for specific apps you are having issues with
	* Check logs in realtime
