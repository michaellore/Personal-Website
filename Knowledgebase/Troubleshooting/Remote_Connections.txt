====== Remote Connections ======

Common protocol to remotely access a computer is SSH. To use SSH, you must have an SSH client on your computer, and an SSH server on the computer you are connecting to.

* Linux - OpenSSH
* Windows - PuTTY

To login, you need an account on the remote machine and the remote hostname or IP address.
	__ssh mike@104.132.155.223__
After logging in, it will be saved as a "known host". You can then send commands securely and even launch programs to work in a GUI.

Log in more securely with SSH public and private keys.

A VPN is another way to connect remotely.

Another remote client is the RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol.

Transferring files:
	* In linux, you can use SCP (secure copy), uses SSH to copy a file to remote.
		* __scp <file to copy> <remote computer>__
		* __scp myfile.txt mike@104.132.155.223__
		* Same command on Windows with Putty using the Putty Secure Copy Client, pscp.exe
	* Easier way to transfer files is the Shared Folder concept


@remote @ssh
