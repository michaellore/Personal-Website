Computer security works on 3 basic principles - the CIA - confidentiality, integrity, availability.
Essential terms:
	* Risk - possibility of suffering a lodd in the event of an attack
	* Vulnerability - a flaw in the system that could be exploited to compromise the system
	* 0-day vulnerability - a vulnerability unknown to the developer but known to an attacker
	* Exploit - software used to take advantage of a bug or vulnerability
	* Threat - the possibility of danger that could exploit a vulnerability
	* Hacker - person who tries to break into system
		* Black hat - tries to break in maliciously
		* White hat - tries to find weaknesses to alert owner before it can be exploited
	* Attack - actual attempt at causing harm
Common forms of malware
	* Virus - virus attaches to an executable and infects other files, replicating itself
	* Worms - can "live" on their own and spread through channels like the network
	* Adware - softwware displaying ads and collecting data
	* Trojan - malware that disguises itself, "trojan horse"
	* Spyware - malware that spies on you
	* Keylogger - records keystrokes
	* Randomware - holds your system hostage until you pay a ransom
	* Botnet - malware utilizing a group of machines controlled by an attacker
	* Backdoor - a secret entryway, commonly installed after an attacker has access and wants to maintain
	* Rootkits - provide access and elevated credentials, but not inherently dangerous

Network attacks
	* DNS Cache Poisoning attack - tricks dns server into accepting a fake record to feed you fake addresses when you try to access legitimate websites
	* Man in the middle - attacker is in the middle of two hosts that think they are communicating with each other. Can intercept and modify info in transit - session/cookie hijacking. Rogue access points, installed without knowledge. 
	* Evil twin - identical network to the real one, but controlled by an attacker
	* Denial of Service DoS - tries to prevent access to a service for legitimate users by overwhelming the network. 
		* Ping of death - sends a malformed ping causing buffer overflow
		* Ping flood - sends tons of pings, ICMP echo requests, and server can't keep up
		* SYN flood - sends tons of SYN packets, "half-open" attacks
	* Distributed Denial of Service DDoS - a DoS attack using multiple systems, usually botnets
Injection attacks
	* Cross-site Scripting XSS - can insert code into a service to target user, ex - stealing cookies to get login info
	* SQL injection - target's the website's SQL database to delete or copy data
Password attacks
	* Brute force - trying different combos to guess
	* Dictionary - tries commonly used words and combinations
Social engineering - attacks rely on humans instead of computers
	* Phishing - usually a malicious email disguised a something legit, like a fake bank reset email
	* Spear phihing - specifically targeting an individual or group to seem trustworthy
	* Spoofing - source masquerading as something else, ex - a spoofed email
	* Baiting - enticing a video to do something, like leaving a malware USB around
	* Tailgating - gaining access to restricted area by following a real employee in
