When you have many printers, you need a place to centrally manage them by installing a printer service on a server.

Most OSes have a print service already installed.
	* Linux - CUPS - manage from a simple URL
	* Windows - print and document service
	* Can also use a cloud-based solution
		* allows users to point ot a web browser so no setup is involved on their machine
Print queue or spool - order multiple print jobs will be executed.

A computer can share its printer with another computer on the network
