====== Directory Services ======
See: [[+Active Directory|Active Directory]], [[+OpenLDAP|OpenLDAP]]

A directory server contains lookup service that provides mapping between network resources and their network addresses. Used to organize and manage user accounts, phone numbers, and network drives.

Ideal directory server supports replication - data is copied and distributed across multiple physical servers but appears as one unified datastore for administration. Replication provides redundancy.

Data is organized in a hierarchal system of objects and containers. Containers = organizational units OUs. OUs are kind of like folders which contain other folders or files for the directory service. Directory services provide centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting, AAA

Directory services are an open network standard, multiple protocols
	* DAP - Directory Access Protocol
	* LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol - OpenLDAP, Microsofts Active Directory (AD)
		* Supports wide range of platforms

Client tools for accessing and configuring directory server - Microsoft Office Active Directory Users and Computers, ADUC.

It is smart to give people access based on what they do vs who they are - role-based access control RBAC

LDAP notation:
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
dn - distinguished name
cn - common name
ou - organizational unit
dc - domain component 

LDAP authentication - Bind operation authenticates clinets to directory server
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
Three common ways to authenticate
	* Anonymous - not actually authenticating, anyone could access
	* Simple -need directory name and password, usually sent in plaintext, not secure
	* SASL, Simple Authentication & Security Layer - requires both client and server to authenticate, Kerberos protocol
