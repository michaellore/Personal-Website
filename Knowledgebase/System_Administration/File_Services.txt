====== File Services ======
Allow users to centrally store and share files and folders. 

Network file system - NFS, protovol to allow files to be shared over network. Easiest on Linux. Set a config to note which folders are shareable, then mount the server on each client

In Windows, Samba is the best option, which also includes printer services. Uses the SMB protocol.

An affordable solution instead of setting up a dedicated server, you can use Network Attached Storage, NAS - computer optimized for file storage with a stripped down OS.
