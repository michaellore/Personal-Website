====== Network Services ======
FTP - similar to SSH, not very secure, mostly for web content
SFTP - secure version of FTP, data is sent through SSH and encrypted
TFTP - no authentication or encryption, common to host installation files
PXE or PXE boot - preboot execution, can boot into software available over the network
NTP - network time protocol - keeps clocks synchronized across a network

To troubleshoot a DNS issue, you can use __nslookup. __Nslookup can verify that a host name points to a name server.

Check status of service on Linux with __service <service name> status__
	* service ntp status - will show status of the ntp service
	* sudo service ntp stop - stop the service
	* sudo service ntp start - restart the service
	* sudo service ntp restart - available for most services, stops then starts
	* if you change the config of a service, you usually need to restart it to refresh with __sudo service <service name> reload__

In Windows, check on a status with __Get-Service <service>__
	* __Get-Service <service> | Format-List *__ - provides more info
	* Stop-Service <service> - stops service
	* Start-Service <service> - start service
	* can always use Services Management GUI
