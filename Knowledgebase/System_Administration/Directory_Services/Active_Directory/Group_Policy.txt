WMI Filters - Windows Management Instrumentation - powerful filters to define targeting rules for GPOs
Group policy Result - troubleshooting tool to figure out which policies already apply to specific computers and users
Group Policy Modelling - tool to determine which policies would apply to a computer or user, used for testing changes

Default domain policy - default policy linked to the domain, applies to all computers and users in domain
Default domain controller policy - default policy for domain controllers

Group Policy Settings Reference - spreadsheet defines all GPO policies and prefs, released by Microsoft
Make a backup before making any changes.

To test GPOs, you can create a Test OU and test changes on a copy of the GPO on test machines.

When a computer has multiple policies, they will be applied in precedence rules. GPOs linked to the largest/least specific container are applied first, and will be overwritten by more specific.

Policies with precedence rules applied are a Resultant Set of Policy - RSoP, RSoP Report.
