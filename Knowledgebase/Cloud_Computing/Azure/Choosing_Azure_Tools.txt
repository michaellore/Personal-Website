====== Choosing Azure Tools ======
Broadly, there are two categories of management tools, visual and code based. Visual tools are easy to use, but can provide less granular function compared to code-based tools. Code-based tools have a higher barrier to entry, but are generally quicker to use once you learn commands and parameters.

Imperative code - details each step to achieve the desired outcome
Declarative code - details the outcome and allows the interpreter to decide how to achieve the outcome.

Azure portal provides a friendly graphical UI

Azure mobile app provides access to Azure resources on the go

Azure Powershell is a shell where you can execute cmdlets to perform tasks in Azure, making the process repeatable and automatable compared to doing everything individually in a GUI

Azure CLI - command line interface similar to Powershell where you can execute commands in Bash

ARM Templates - describe the resources you want to use in JSON, template gets verified before code is executed and then orchestrates creation of resources.
