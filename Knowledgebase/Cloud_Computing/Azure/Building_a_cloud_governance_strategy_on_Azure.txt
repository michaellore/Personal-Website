====== Building a cloud governance strategy on Azure ======
Orgs can use Azure service to create a governance strategy - all the rules and policies that maintain control over your apps and their permissions and resources.

Can use role-based access control - applied to scopes (reosurces or sets of resources)

Granting access to a parent scope also gives access to its child scopes.
* assigning a user to the Owner role at the management group scope allows that user to manage all subscriptions in that group
* assigning the Reader role to a group at the subscription scope allows viewing all resources and resource groups in that subscription
* Assigning Contributor role to an application at the reosurce group scope, the app can manage all resources in that specific group

Use cases:
	* allow one user to manage VMs and another to manage networks
	* allow a DB admin to manage SQL databases 

Policies are enforced on all access that pass through the Azure Resource Manager. Manage access permissions on the Access contral (IAM) pane in Azure portal.

You can apply locks to subscriptions, groups, and resources. 
	* CanNotDelete - authorized people can read and modify but can't delete
	* ReadOnly - authorized people can read a resource but not make any changes

Resource locks apply regardless of permissions. You can combine resource locks using Azure lueprints to help prevent accidental lock removals.

You can add tags to resources to provide extra info and metadata to keep them organized. Resource tags contain a name and a value.
	Examples:
		* AppName
		* CostCenter
		* Owner
		* Environment
		* Impact

Azure Policy is a service allowing you to create and manage policies that control and audit resources. Policies enforce rules to help stay compliant.
	* create policy definition
	* assign definition to resources
	* review evaluation results

Azure policy initiative is a way of grouping related policies together. For example, the Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center initative includes the policies:
	* monitor unencrypted SQL database
	* monitor os vulnerabilities
	* monitor missing endpoint protection

Azure Blueprints can be used to definie repeatable sets of governing policies and role assignments, so everything does not need to be set for each new subscription. Every component of a blueprint is a blueprint artifact.

ISO 27001 is a standard applying to the security of IT systems and azure has several built in blueprints for it.
