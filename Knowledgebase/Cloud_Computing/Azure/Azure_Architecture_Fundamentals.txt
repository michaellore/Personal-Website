Organizational Structure
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
* Resources - instance sof services like VMs
* Resource groups - containers that hold resources
* Subscriptions - groups together user accounts and the resources created by them. can set limits or quoatas to manage costs
* Management groups - manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions

Multiple Azure subscriptions can be used to manage environments, departments, and billing. Test and Deployment, limiting teams to certain resources, tracking costs. Subscriptions are sorted into management groups

Azure regions - geographical areas that host at least one physical data center. There are specia US Gov and China regions
Availability zones - physical data centers within the region that are separate and independent and privde protection against downtime

Some Azure services work with availability zones, 3 categories
	* zonal services - resource pined to a specific zone
	* zone - redundant - platform replicates across multiple zones
	* non-regional - resilient to region and zone outages

Regions are always paired with a region at least 300 miles away

Azure Resource Manager - management layer for Azure resources
	* use templates rather than scripts to manage resources
	* manage resources as a group instead of individually
	* apply tags to resources 
	* clarify billing by viewing costs sorted by tag
