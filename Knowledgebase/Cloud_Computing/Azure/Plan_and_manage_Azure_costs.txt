====== Plan and manage Azure costs ======
You can use the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to estimate your costs running on Azure vs running on your on-premises datacenter. The TCO Calculator generates reports based on your workloads, including servers, DBs, Storage, networking, and your associated costs such as wages and electricity costs.

Azure Advisor can make suggestions to help minimize costs to match your actual workload.

Spending limits can be implemented to stop services at cost limits.

Azure reservations  can help you get discounted prices by reserving services by paying in advance. For example, you can prepay for a year of VM use.

Azure Cost Management + Billing is a tool to help break down your costs by resource, and can generate reports and budgets and set appropriate alerts.

Tags cna be applied to resources to help group together costs by department.

VMs can be resized or deallocatted when idle or not needed. This preserves data but shuts down VMs when not needed.

Remember to turn off and delete any unused resources.

Some licenses can be repurposed on Azure VMs through Azure Hybrid Benefit.
