====== Secure network connectivity on Azure ======
Use a defense-in-depth strategy made up of layers with security in mind. Azure provides several tools for network defense, Azure Firewall, network security groups, and Azure DDoS Protection.

Defense in depth is a set of layers with the data at the center
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
* physical - first line, securing access to buildings and hardware
* identity and access - controlling access by ensuring identities are verified and logged
* perimeter - DDoS protection and firewalls to protect from network-based attacks
* network - limit comms between resources, deny by default, restrict inbound access and limit outbound access, allow only what is required
* compute - secure access to VMs, endpoint protection, keep systems updated
* application - ensure all apps are secure and updated, store secrets in a secure medium
* data - secure databases 

Security posture - org's ability to protect and respond to threats
	* confidentiality -principle of least privilege - info granted on a need to know basis
	* integrity - prevent unauthorized changes to info
	* availability - ensure services are available and accesible only to authorized users

Azure firewall - security service that protects your Azure resources. 
	* stateful - anaylzes complete context of a network connection and not just indivudual network packets
	* built in availability
	* cloud scalability
	* inbound and outbound rules
	* Inbound destination network address translation (DNAT) support

you can configure
	* application rules defining fully qualified domain names
	* network rules that define source addr, protocol, destination port & address
	* network address translation rules that define destination IP addresses and ports to translate inbound requests

Azure DDoS Protection helps protect from DDoS attacks by idenitfying and block DDoS traffic while allowing legit traffic to flow. 
Comes in tiers
	Basic
		* automatically enabled for free
		* always on traffic monitoring, real time mitigation of common attack

	Standard
		* additional mitigation compared to Basic
		* protection policies tuned through traffic monitoring and machine learning

	Types of attacks:
		* volumetric - flood the network with huge amounts of seemingly legit traffic
		* protocol - exploit weakness in the level 3 and level 4 protocol stack
		* resource-layer (only with web app firewall) - target wbe app packets to disrupt transmission of data between hosts
Network security group - allows you to filter traffic between Azure resources within Azure virtual network. Like an internal firewall.
