====== Choosing the right Azure Services ======
It's important to examine your SLAs and service lifecycle to choose the right Azure services.
SLA - service-level agreement, an agreement between the service company and the customer. For Azure, it is Microsoft's agreement with you.
Each Azure service has its own SLA. SLA gneerally broken down into 3 components
	* Intro - scope of SLA
	* General terms - defines vocabulary use din SLA so both parties understand the terms of the agreement
	* SLA details - specific service guarantees, generally focused on guaranteed uptime
Downtime refers to the time a service is unavailable.

A service credit is the percentage of fees paid that you are credited back whenever a service does not comply with its SLA.
Credits typically increase as uptime decreases.

Free services do not typically have an SLA. The Azure status page provides updates on service status. 

You typically need to file a claim with MS to receive a service credit.

An application SLA defines the SLA for a specific application that you build on Azure. To help define your SLA, consider the following:
	* business impact - what happens if the app goes down
	* effec ton other business operations 
	* usage patterns - how and when users access your app

A workload is a capability or task that is logically separated from all other tasks. For your app, assume you will need
	* two VMs
	* one Azure SQL database
	* one Azure load balancer

Identify the SLA for each individual workload in your app, and then combine them to get your composite SLA.

If your composite SLA does not meet your requirements, say of 99.99% uptime, there are several options you can take. You can deploy your VMs across different availability zones to remove single points of failure, or you can increase redundancy. Performance above 88.88% is very hard to achieve.

The service lifecycle defines how every Azure service is released. Every features starts in the development phase, then is released for public preview to gather real-world feedback. Finally it is released to all customers as production-ready, called general-availability (GA).
