Disks come in many sizes and performances, SSDs to traditional spinning HDDs for less critical ops, premium SDs for production apps, ultra disks for data-intensive workloads.

Azure Blob is object storage solution - can store massive amounts of text or binary data, huge video files, mass simultaneous uploads. Does not require devs to manage disks at all

Azure Files - fully managed file shares, access files from anywhere in the world. store config files in the share and access form multiple VMs.

Blob Storage tiers:
	* Hot - storing data used frequently - website images
	* cool - infrequently access, stored for at least 30 days - customer invoices
	* archive - rare access, stored at least 100 days - long-term backups

Hot and cool tiers can be set at account level. All tiers can be set at blob level
Archive data stores offline and has lowest storage cost, but higher cost to rehydrate and access that data
