====== Azure AI ======
Two approaches to AI - deep learning, modeled on the neural network of the human brain, and machine learning, where existing data is used to train a model and then the model is used on new data.

Azure offers 3 distinct product options for AI solutions.

Azure machine learning - platform for making predictions. tools that connect to data to train and test models. and then deploy them in real time.
	* create a process to define how data is obtain, handled, and split into tests
	* train and evaluate models
	* create pipelines defining when and where experiements are run on algorithms
	* deploy best-performing algorithm as an API to be used in real time by apps

Azure cognitive services - prebuilt machine learning models that enable apps to see, hear, speak, understand, and begin to reason. Solve problems, analyze text for emotion, analyze images to recognize faces
	* language services - natural language processing to evaluate sentiment
	* speech - speech to text and text to natural speech, translation and speaker verification
	* vision - analysis of pictures, video, other visuals
	* decision - personal recommendations for users that automatically improve with use, content moderation.

Azure bot service and bot framework - platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions like a human. uses other Azure AI services to understand what human users are asking for
	* simple repetitive tasks
	* quick q&a or sophisticated conversations
