Combining philosophies and practices of technical teams to achieve common goals. Automating development, deployment, and maintenance. Azure has several tools to help achieve devops goals.

Azure DevOps Services
	* Azure Repos - centralized source code repositories
	* Azure Boards - agile project management suite, kanban boards, reporting, and tracking
	* Azure Pipelines - continuous integration and deployment automation tool
	* Azure Artifacts - repository for hosting artifacts such as compiled source code
	* Azure test plans - automated test tool used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before software release

Also available are github and github actions - github actions enables workflow automation with triggers for events. Github is a more lightweight tool than Azure Devops with more focus on individual developers. Azure devops has more granualar permission rules and excels at project management

Azure DevTest labs - automated means of building, setting up, and tearing down the VMs that contain builds of your software
