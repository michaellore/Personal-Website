====== Azure Identity Services ======
Two fundamental concepts - authorization and authentication.
	* Authentication establishes the idenitity of a person requesting access
	* authorization establishes what level of access an authenticated person has

Azure Active Directory provides identity services that enable users to sign in and access Microsoft cloud apps well as cloud apps you develop. Similar to [[Knowledgebase:System Administration:Directory Services:Active Directory|Active Directory,]] Azure AD ensures the service is available globally. 
Provides:
	* Authentication - verifying identity, self-service password reset, multifactor auth
	* Single sign-on (SSO) - one username and password for multiple apps, identity tied to user
	* App management - manage cloud and on-site apps with Application proxy, My Apps portal, for better UI
	* Device management - register devices to be managed using conditional access policies
	* Can manage external resources like office 365 and internal resources

You can connect Azure AD to Active Directory in multiple ways but the easiest is Azure AD Connect, which synchronizes identities between the on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. 

Multifactor auth - user is prompted for an additional form of identity beyond a password
	* something the user knows - email and password
	* something the user has - a code sent to a phone
	* something the user is - biometric, like a fingerprint or face scan

Conditional Access - allow or deny access based on identity signals. For example, a user might not be challenged for a second factor if they are at a known location on a known device.
	* require multifactor for all users or only certain users
	* allow access to services only through approved apps or approved devices
	* block access from unapproved sources, such as unkown devices or unexpected locations
