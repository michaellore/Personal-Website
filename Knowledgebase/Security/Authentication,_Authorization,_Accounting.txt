====== Authentication, Authorization, Accounting ======
Identification - describing an identity uniquely
Authentication - providing a password or some other info to prove it is you
Authorization - the resources an identity has access to
There is often a tradeoff between security and usability - risk mitigation
Multifactor Authentication - using an additional security factor besides a password, like biometrics or a physical token, or a one time password on an app or device, or through SMS

Servers can authenticate and verify clients with client certificates. The CA has a signed list, certificate revocation list, that defines certificates that have been explicitly revoked.

Directory services used as a backend for authentication of user accounts.

Kerberos - network auth protocol that uses tickets to allow entities to prove their identity over potentially insecure channels using symmetric encryption.

Single Sign-On SSO - auth concept that allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services through a central server - logging into Google account allows access to gmail, youtube, adsense, etc.

OAuth - open standard that allows users to grant third party apps and websites access to their info without providing credentials. Lists specific permissions you are granting.

Access Control List - way of defining permissions for objects

Accounting - recording access and usage
Auditing - Reviewing records of access and usage
