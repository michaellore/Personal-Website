====== Symmetric Cryptography ======
Symmetric-key algorithm - use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages
Substitution cipher - replaces parts of your plaintext with ciphertext
	* Caesar cipher - replacing letters and numbers by shifting or rotating, the offset is the key 
	* ROT13 - alphabet rotated 13 places, Caesar cipher with a key of 13.
Stream cipher - takes a stream of input and encrypts one character at a time, outputting one encrypted character at a time
Block cipher - takes data in, places it in a bucket or block of fixed size, then encodes that block as one unit
	* Stream ciphers generally faster and easier, but can be less secure
Initialization vector - a bit of random data inserted into key to prevent key reuse
	* Have a master key + IV combo to have a unique key
Key size - total number of bits that comprizes the key. Upper limit for total possible keys in a given algorithm.

DES - data encryption standard, Symmetric block cipher with 64-bit key sizes, 8-bits used for parity checking, blocks 64-bits. 
AES - advanced encryption standard - similar to DES, uses 128-bit blocks and 128, 192, or 256 bit key length.

Benefits 
	relatively easy to implement and maintain
	very fast and efficient

Downsides
	Key must be shared with every device
