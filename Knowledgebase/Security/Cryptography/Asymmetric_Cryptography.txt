====== Asymmetric Cryptography ======
Different keys used for encryption and decryption. Public key ciphers.
Both generate a private key, which a public key is derived from. After generating public/private pairs, exhange public keys.
Use public key to encrypt and send messge, and private key to decrypt it.

Public key signatures - signing a message with private key to create a digital signature, other person can verify using public key 
MAC - bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring it came from the alleged sender and message was not modified
	* HMAC - keyed-has MAC, uses a hash function along with a secret key
	* CMAC - cipher-based MAC. uses a symmetric cipher with shared keys
	* CBC-Mac - cipher block chaining MAC, encrypts a message with block cipher in CBC mode, that incorprates a previously encrypted block into the next block's plaintext to make a chain of encrypted blocks, and the full encrypted chain is needed to decrypt

RSA - one of the first asymmetric systems, key generation depends on pairs of large prime numbers
DSA - similar to RSA, used for signing and verifying data
ECC - elliptic curve cryptography - uses algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to generate keys
	* allows generation of smaller keys that are secure

Benefits
	Grants confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation
	Allows secure comms over an unsecure channel

Downsides
	more complex, slower

Often companies will use asymmetric encryption to send a shared secret, and then data can be sent using symmetric encryption
