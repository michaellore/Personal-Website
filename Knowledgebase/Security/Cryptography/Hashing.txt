====== Hashing ======
a function or operation that takes arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of a fixed size, called a hash. Output is unique to the input.
Hashing can be used to identify duplicate sin databases or archives to speed up lookups
Cryptographic hashing - different from encryption, one-directional
Same input should always return same hash value. Two different inputs should never output to the same output.

MD5 - 512bit blocks, 128bit hash digests. Susceptible to hash collisions, recommended to use SHA2, SHA3
SHA1 - part of Secure Hash Algorithm suite of functions 512bit blocks, 160bit hash digest
MIC - message integrity check, a hash digest of the message, like a checksum

Hashs often used for authentacation - passwords are often hashed and are checked on login.

Rainbow table - precomputed table of passwrods and corresponding hashes used to speed up password attacks

Salt - additional random data added in hashing function to generate a hash thats unique to password and salt combo
