====== Cryptography ======
Hiding a message from potential attackers.

Key terms:
	Encryption - taking a plaintext message, applying an operation called a cipher, so you receive garbled unreadable text as output - ciphertext
	Decryption - translating ciphertext back into readable text.
	Encryption Algorithm - underlying logic used to convert plaintext to ciphertext
	Key - introduces a unique element into your cipher to make it unique from others using same algorithm
	Security through obscurity - keeping your algorithm secret
	Cryptosystem, Kerchoff's Principle - a collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption/decryption should remain secure, even if everything except the key is known. Even if enemy knows exactly what kind of system, system is secure as long as keys remain secure. Shannon's maxim.
	Cryptology - study of crytography, practice of coding and hiding messages
	Cryptanalysis - trying to decipher coded messages
	Frequency Analysis - practice of studying frequency with which letters appear in a ciphertext
	Steganography - hiding information, but not encrypting it

Public key infrastructure - defines creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates
Digital certificate - file that proves an entity owns a certain public key
Certificate authority - entity responsible for storing, issuing, and signing certificates
Code signing available for software to verify author

PHP - pretty good privacy - authentication of data with privacy relying on asymmetric encryption. widely used in email encryption

Securing Network traffic
	VPNs, encrypted tunnel
	IPSec - vpn protocol encrypts an IP packet and sends it with the inside an IPsec packet
	Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol - L2TP, supports VPNs, tunnelling protocol that allows for encapsulation of other protocols that may not be otherwise supported
	
Hardware Cryptography
	TPM - Trusted Platform Module - hardware device that is a dedicated crypto processor, offers generation of secure keys, random numbers, etc
	TEE - Trusted Execution Environment - isolated execution environment that isolates processes from the main OS
	FDE - Full Disk Encryption - encryption of the entire disk
