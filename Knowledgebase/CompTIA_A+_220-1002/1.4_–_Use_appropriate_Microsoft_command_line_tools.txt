====== 1.4 â€“ Use appropriate Microsoft command line tools ======
sometimes a command line is all you have available
standard user and administrator - standard can run most commands but admin is needed for some - type cmd then CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER
type exist to close

Use 'help' with command for help directory
	help chkdsk
	or use [command] /?

dir - lists files and directories
cd - change directory
.. - reference folder above current folder
shutdown - shuts down the computer
	shutdown /s /t nn - wait nn seconds, then shutdown
	shutdown /r /t nn - shutdown and restart after nn seconds
shutdown /a - abort the countdown sequence, do not shutdown

dism - Deployment image servicing and management tool
	manage windows imaging format WIM files
	make changes to windows images - update apps, drivers, manage updates, mount an image
	__/Get-WIMInfo /WimFile:d:\sources\boot.wim__
		get the info of the WIM file at this location
		
sfc - system file checker, scan integrity of all protected system files
	sfc /scannow - scan system and locate and fix corrupted files

chkdsk /f - fixes logical system errors on disk
chkdsk /r - locates bad sectors and recovers readable info - much more intensive, does /f first
	if volume is locked - choose to run during startup and reboot

diskpart - manage disk configuration, list disks, volumes, create new, format

tasklist - displays list of running processes

taskkill - terminate tasks by process id (PID) or image name
	taskkill /IM notepad.exe
	taskkill /PID 1234 /T
		tasklist will show the PID
		/T to temrinate

Group policy - manage computers in active directory
	updated at login
	use gpupdate to force an update
		gpudate /target:(computer/user) /force
			gpupdate /target:mike /force 
			
	gpresult - verify policy settings for a computer or user
		gpresult /r - group policy settings for computer
		gpresult /user sgc/mike /v - policy settings on a rmeote device

format - formats a disk for use in windows
	can delete data - be careful

copy - copies file to new directory
	/v - verifies new files are written correctly
	/y - suppress prompting to overwrite if the file already exists at destination
		copy /v myfile.txt d:/my documents

xcopy - copies files and directory trees
	xcopy /s Documents D:\backups
		copies documents folder and subdirectories to the backups folder

robocopy - robust file copy - better xcopy, can resume copying if it is interrupted
	robocopy /s Documents D:\backups

**Network command line tools**
ipconfig - ping local router/gateway
	tells tcp/ip and network adapter info, DNS info, dhcp server
	ipconfig /all - even more info

ping - test reachability, determines round trip time, use sinternet control message protocol (ICMP)
	primary troubleshooting tool
	performs 4 pings before it stops
	shows time it tool and time to live ttl
	TTL counts number of hops between your device and destination ping
	pinging an ip not on the network will time out

tracert - determine the route a packet takes to its destination
	map the entire path from source to destination
	uses ICMP time to live error messages
	some firewalls will filter the messages, so may not always be the best tool
		some OSs like linux and macos can use different protocol 
			iOS sends udp datagrams over port 33434
{{.\pasted_image.png?width=800}}
	Tracert can show where in the process the problem is

netstat - network statistics, many different oses
	netstat -a - shows all active connections
	netstat -b - shows binaries with inbound and outbound
	netstat -n do not resolve names, show ip addresses

nslookup - lookup info from DNS servers
	canonical names, ip addresses, cache timers
	can lookup by ip address or name

net - specific to windows
	view network resources - net view \\<servername> or net view /workgroup:<workgroupname>
	map network share to drive letter - net use h: \\servername\sharename
	view user account info and reset password 
		net user <username>
		net user <username> * /domain
