====== 2.9 â€“ Implement appropriate data destruction and disposal methods ======

Physical destruction
	Shredder - heavy machinery - total destruction
	Drill/hammer - quick and easy
	electromagnetic (degaussing) - removes magnetic field, destroys data drive and electronics
	incineration

Certificate of destruction - often done by a third party, gives confirmation and a paper trail for data

Disk formatting - low level formatting, provided at the factory not by the user

Quick format - installs boot sector, clears master file table but does not delete data
	can be recovered

Regular format - overwrite every sector on drive with zeros, can't be recovered

People often forget to format a drive before selling.

If you don't want to format, use a tool like Sdelete to securely delete files and folders
