====== 2.7 â€“ Implement security best practices to secure a workstation ======

Make your password strong
	no single words
	no obvious passwords
	mix upper and lower, special character
	at least 8 characters - consider a phrase or set of words
	set password expiration, require change
		30, 60, 90 days
		recovery process should not be trivial 	
	change default usernames/passwords on infrastructure
	always require passwords - no blank, no auto logins
	
	BIOS/UEFI password
		supervisor - prevent bios changes
		user - prevent booting

Automatic lock when system goes unused

Disable autorun in registry - devices automatically start on insert
	not in windows 7/8/10

Consider changing autoplay.

Restrict user permissions - only give users what they need
	assign rights based on groups - not per user
	login time restrictions
	disable unnecessary accounts like guest accounts
	disable interactive logins - not all accounts need to login
	change default username and passwords

Implement a lockout policy for continuous wrong passwords
	normal for most users
	can cause issues for service accounts
	Disable user account when an employee leaves org - may not want to delete immediately

Users and passwords can be managed from active directory
	add users to domain
	reset passwords, unlock accounts
	disable accounts

Full disk encryption - encrypt the entire drive with bitlocker
Filesystem encryption - EFs, files and folders
Encrypt removable media

Also backup decryption keys - integrated into active directory

Always keep os and app security patches up to date
	built into os at home
	deployment managed in stages at organizations
	many apps have their own update checker inside the app
