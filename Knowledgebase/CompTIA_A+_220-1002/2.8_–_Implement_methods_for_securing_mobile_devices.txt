====== 2.8 â€“ Implement methods for securing mobile devices ======

Screen lock - restrict access to device
	need fingerprint, face unlock, swipe, passcode
	ios - erase data after 10 attempts
	android - log in to google account

Built in GPS - find phone on map
	play sound
	wipe data remotely

remote backup - backup to the cloud
	constant - not manual
	no wires, uses the network
	restore with one click
	
antivirus
	apple - tightly closed, regulated
	Android - more open, apps can be installed from everywhere
	apps run in a sandbox

keep devices up to date with patches and security updates
	security, os updates

Biometric auth
	multifactor - facescan and pin

authenticator app
	psuedo random token generator used during login process
	used to be physical key - software is more convenient

Encrypt all device data - phone keeps the key
	iOS 8 and later - your passcode is the key

In android, be careful installing random apk files - sideloading
	in apple, all apps are curated
	
Most phones have no firewall - activity is outbound
	there are some third party apps, not very used
	enterprise environments can control mobile apps

BYOD - bring your own device - use personal device for work
	use a mobile device manager to centralize management
	set policies on apps, data , camera
		entire device or make a business "partition"
