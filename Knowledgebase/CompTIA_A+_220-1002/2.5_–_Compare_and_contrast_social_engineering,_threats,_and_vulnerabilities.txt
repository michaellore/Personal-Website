====== 2.5 â€“ Compare and contrast social engineering, threats, and vulnerabilities ======

Social engineering techniques always changing - may include multiple people and orgs, in person or electronic, phone calls/emails
	Authority - social engineer poses as an authority figure 0 ceo/police
	Intimidate - threaten bad things if no help - paychecks won't get sent out
	Consensus/social proof - convince based on normal expectation - Jill did this for me last week
	Scarcity - tight time frame
	Urgency - act quickly, don't think
	Familiarity/Likable - I am a friend
	Trust - I'm in IT I am safe

	Phishing - often done by spam or IM
		looks legit, check the URL
		usually something not quite right
		Voice phishing - Vishing - done over the phone, fake IRS or bank
	
	Spear phishing - focus on the top - target accounts payable
		"Whaling" - target the CEO
		april 2011 epsilon - targetted email service staff
	
	Impersonation - use details from online, trash
		impersonator will often pose as a higher rank and call a lower rank
		use lots of technical babble
	
	Shoulder surfing - you have access to info, people just look over your shoulder
	
	Tailgating - use someone else to gain physical access
		blend in with similar clothing
		hang out in smoking section
		most security stops at the door
	
	Dumpster diving - people throw away a lot of info
		can then impersonate names, phone numbers, address
		especially at end of month/quarter
		usually legal in the US if it's not private property

Denial of service - force a service to fail by overloading
	takes advantage of a design failure or vulnerability
	create a smokescreen for a different attack
	doesn't have to be comlicated - turn off the power
	"friendly" dos - not always a bag guy
		Network DoS - switching plugged into each other making a loop
		Bandwidth DoS - big downloads over a DSL line
		Water main break

Distributed denial of service - army of computers used to bring donw a service
	often a botnet - many users don't even know it's happening
	huge use of bandwith and resources overload the service
	sometimes you can see a traffic pattern and filter it out
		ISP may have more resources
		third party tech - cloudflare

Zero day attacks - vulnerability we don't know about yet
	many people finding vulnerability - good guys share with devs, bad guys exploit or sell
	increasingly common
	Common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE) list
	Example - march 2017 cve-2017-0199 - ms office/wordpad remote code executed when a file was opened
					May 2019 - windows error report service allowed elevated access to normal accounts

Man-in-the-middle - intercepts and redirects your traffic - you never know
	ARP poisoning - arp has no security
		device asks router what its mac address is and caches it
		MITM - attacker lies and says it is the correct router, your device updates the arp cache with the attacker's address
	mitigate with secure protocols - https, ssh
	use a vpn
	avoid insecure public wireless networks
	
Brute force attacks - passwords are hashed and the hash is stored - passwords are hashed when entered and checked against stored hash
	constantly trying hashes is a brute force attack
		can be done online - very slow, often can get locked out
		offline - get a list of users and hashes, calculate the password hash and compare it to stored
			very intensive
	
	dictionary attack - people use common words as pass, use a list of these words
		123456, password123
		many common wordlists are on the internet - customized by language and industry
	
	rainbow table - optimized prebuilt set of hashes
		calculations are already done, very fast
		need different tables for different hash methods
			windows different from MySQL
		won't work with salted hashes - an additional random element added to hash

Spoofing - pretend to be something you aren't - fake web server, fake dns server
	email address spoofing - sender isn't really the sender
	caller id spoofing
	man in the middle attacks

MAC spoofing 
	ethernet device has a unique burned in mac address
		most drivers allow you to change
		changing can be legit
		certain apps can require a certain mac
		
		if it's fake, it can be trying to circumvent an access control list
			very hard to tell - how do you know?
			
IP spoofing - pretend to be somewhere you aren't
	can be legit - load balancing/testing
	may not be legit - arp poisoning/ddos
	easier to identify than mac spoofing - you know what ip's to expect
	
Non-compliant systems
	a constant challenge - changes and updates always made
	standard operating envirnments (SOE)
		set of tested/approved hardware and software
			os and apps updates must be tested for compliance
		apply policies to prevent non-compliant software
		monitor the network traffic
		perform routine compliance scans - can force compliance before giving access
