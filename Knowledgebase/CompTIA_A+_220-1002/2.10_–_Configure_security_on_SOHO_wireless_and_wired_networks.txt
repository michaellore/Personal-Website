====== 2.10 â€“ Configure security on SOHO wireless and wired networks ======

Change your SSID from the default, or disable broadcasting entirely
	easily found through wireless analysis
	security through obscurity

Wireless encryption very important - anyone can listen in
	everyone gets the password - only allowed users can decrypt the info

Use as low-power a signal power as you can without negatively affecting performance

WPS - wifi protected setup (originally wifi simple config)
	allows easy device setup
	pin on access point entered on device
	push a button on access point
	NFC
	USB - no longer used
	Dec 2011- wps hack
		pin is 8 digit number, 7 digits and a checksum
		two parts, 4 digit and 3 digit
		only 10000 combos in first half, 1000 in second - only takes 4 hours to go through all possibilities
			most devices have a lockout function

Change default username and password for routers and access points
	credentials provide admin access!

Limit access to network by hardware MAC address
	easy to find allowed mac through wireless analysis
	can be spoofed
	security through obscurity - once you know a working mac it is not useful

A static IP is not a security technique.

SOHO firewalls are often combined with router in one device. Keep firmware up to date.

Firewall settings - extensive filtering
	allow only required traffic
	port forwarding
	outbound traffic - blacklist - allow all, block unwanted
					- whitelist - block all, allow only wanted traffic

Disable physical ports and interfaces that aren't needed. 

NAC - network access control - even if you are plugged in you need to provide credentials

Content filtering - block sensitive or inappropriate data
	parental controls, block disallowed sites

Physical security important too - lots of security is bypassed with physical access
