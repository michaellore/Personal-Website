====== 1.3 â€“ Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods ======

You need a boot media
	USB Drive - must be bootable and supported by computer
	CD/DVD - common, but not all computers have drives
	PXE (Pixie) Preboot execution environment - perform install over the network, common in enterprise
	Netboot - similar to PXE, used for macOS
	Solid state / hard drives - can store many OSes for installation
	External/hot swappable - some can mount an ISO to make the computer think it is a DVD image - boot from usb
	Internal drive - create and boot from a new partition on your internal drive

Unattended installation - answer prompts in a file (unattend.xml) and install with no interruptions

In place upgrade - upgrade while maintaining apps and data

Clean install - wipes the slate clean. Migration tools can help backup and restore

Image - deploy a clone of the os on every computer

Repair install - fixes issues with the windows OS does not modify user files

Multiboot - run multiple os on same computer, choose on startup

Recovery partition - hiddne partition with install files, used with repair to fix problems without needing original media
	Refresh/restore option on windows 10

Disk partition - separates physical drive into logical pieces - keep data separate
	Partition for each OS
	Formatted partition called a volume in Windows
	
	MBR style - master boot record, old standard
		primary - bootable, max of 4 primary partitions per disk, one marked Active to boot by default
		extended - one per disk, can contain additional logical partitions which aren't bootable
			Partitions are referred to by a drive letter
	
	GPT - GUID partition table
		globally unique identifier
		newest standard
		requires UEFI bios or bios compatibility mode - bios compatibility mode disables SecureBoot
		128 partitions per device
		no need for extended partitions or logical drives
		
	Partitioning is the first step in preparing a new disk
		may already be partitioned - existing partitions may not be compatible
		Serious potential for data loss - changing, rmeoving or deleting partitions can delete data

Storage types - layered on top of the partition and file system
	
	Basic disk storage
		available in dos and windows versions
		primary/extended partitions, logical drives
		can't span separate physical disks

	Dynamic disk storage
		modern windows
		span multiple disks across one large volume
		split data across physical disks (striping)
		duplicate data across physical disks (mirroring)
		
File system - partition must be formatted
	Common are Fat32 and NTFS
	Windows can read FAT, FAT32, NTFS, exFAT
	
	FAT - file allocation table - old, one of the first pc filesystem
	FAT32 - larger volumes 2TB, max file size of 4GB
	exFat - Extended file allocation table - flash drive file system, supports larger files
	
	NTFS - NT file system
		improves over fat32
		larger volumes and file size support, quotas, file compression, encryption, symbolic links, better recoverability
	
	CDFS - compact disk file system
		ISO 9660 standard
		All os can read the CD
	
	Ext3 - third extended file system, common used by Linux
	ext4 - fourth extended file system, update to ext3, seen in Linux and Android
	
	NFS - network file system
		access files across the network as if they were local
		clients available on many os
	
	HFS+ - hierarchical file system, aka mac os extended
		replaced by apple file system (APFS) in mac os high sierra (10.13)

Swap partition - memory management
	frees up memory by moving unused pages to the disk
	copies back to Ram when needed
	usually a fast drive or ssd

Quick format - creates new file table, doesn't erase data, no physical health checks
	default formal in 7/8/10
	diskpart command does full format

Full format - writes zeroes to the whole disk
	data is unrecoverable
	checks disk for physical bad sectors - time consuming
	
**Installing and upgrading Windows**
	know what info is on the drive - remember to backup important files
	partitioning and formatting occur during install
	make sure you meet minimum reqs - windows 10 upgrade checker
	know drive/partition info and have license key ready
	
	upgrade - keep files in place, start setup from inside existing OS
	install - start over fresh, setup from boot
	upgrades can save a ton of time by keeping user configs and program installs in place
	
	You can't upgrade from 32 to 64 bit, need to use a migration tool for that

After installing, you will want to run updates to get security patches, driver updates, etc
