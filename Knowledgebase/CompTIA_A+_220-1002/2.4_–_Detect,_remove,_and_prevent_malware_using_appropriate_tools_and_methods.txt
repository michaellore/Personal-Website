====== 2.4 â€“ Detect, remove, and prevent malware using appropriate tools and methods ======

Ransomware - locks or appears to lock computer, requesting money to unlock
	may be fake
	may be avoided - maybe remove with antimalware

Crypto-malware - new ransomware, encrypts system
	need a key to decrypt - you need to pay to get the key
	always have an offline backup available

Trojan horse - used by Greeks to take Troy
	software that pretends to be something else to takke over PC
	Can easily circumvent or disable your security 
	Once in may install other programs

Spyware - malware that spies on you
	advertising, identity theft
	may trick you into installing
	monitors browsing habits

Keylogger - logs keyboard storkes, passwords, bank info
	saves everything you type
	circumvents encryption protection - keylogger happens first
	may also capture clipboard, take screenshots

Rootkit - originally a unix technique
	modifies core system files, part of the kernel
	Invisible to the system - won't see it in task manager
	invisible to most av software

Virus - malware that can reproduce itself
	needs you to run it
	can reporduce through file system or network
	may or may not actually cause problems
	very common - thousands new every week
	
	Program virus - part of an application
	Boot sector - starts on boot
	Script - os and browser based
	Macro - common in MS office plugins

Worms - malware that self rpelicates
	no user intervention
	uses network for transmission
	spreads very quickly
	Firewalls can mitigate infestation, but not much help if it is already in system
	
	Wannacry worm - infected pc searches for other vulnerable system
		Eternal blue exploit - then process repeats

Botnet - robot networks
	once your machine is infected, it becomes a bot
	Can get it from a trojan horse, app vulnerability
	receives instructions from a third party
	
You need antivirus and antimalware
	Real time and on demand scans
	Modern software recognizes suspicious activity, not just exact virus signature
	
	Windows Recovery Environment - very powerful and dangerous front end
		gives you complete control of the os before the system starts
		enable/disable services/devices, repair file system boot sector
		
		Windows 7 - boot form install media or use F8
		Windows 8/10 - install media, Troubleshoot/Advanced options/Command promt
		you need to use command prompt, exact commands
		
	Always have a good backup - best insurance policy
		built into windows - backup and restore
		only way to be sure it's gone	
	
	one on one training, high-viz posters, login messages can all help educate users
	
	Software based local firewall to monitor for suspicious traffic - run by default
	
	External/hosted DNS service can help block known-bad websites
