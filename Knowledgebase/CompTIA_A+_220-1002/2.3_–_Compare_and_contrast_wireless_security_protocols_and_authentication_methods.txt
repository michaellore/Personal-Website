====== 2.3 â€“ Compare and contrast wireless security protocols and authentication methods ======

All wireless computers are transmitters and receivers, so we must encrypt data
	One password for all, or everyone gets their own password
	WPA - wifi protected access, created in 2002, replacement for WEP (wired equivalent privacy)
		short term bridge between WEP and a successor - runs on existing hardware
		RC4 with TKIP - temporal key integrity protocol
			Initialization vector IV is larger and has an encrypted hash
			Every packet has unique 128 bit encryption key
			TKIP mixes the secret key with IV
			Adds sequence counter
			64 bit message integrity check protects against tampering
			TKIP deprecated in 2012
	
	WPA2 cert began in 2004
		AES (advanced encryption standard) replaced RC4
		CCMP (counter mode with cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol) replaced tkip
			block cipher, 128bit key and 128 bit block size
			requires additional computing resources
			Data confidentiality (AES), authentication, and access control

	Configure your security on router/access point
		open - no password
		wpa2-personal/psk - everyone uses same password, common at home
		wpa2-enterprise /wpa2-802.1X - authenticates users individually with auth server (RADIUS, TACACS), multiple factors
			RADIUS - remote auth dial in user service
				common AAA protocol, authenticate authorization account
				central management of auth for user
				built into most server os
			
			TACACS - terminal access controller access-control system
				remote auth protocol - created to control access to dialup to ARPANET - around a long time
				
			TACACS+ - new versiom
					more auth requests and response codes
					released as open standard in 1993
