====== 4.2 â€“ Implement basic change management best practices ======

Change control - formal process for managing changes
	avoid downtime and issues
	nothing changes without following process
	
		determine scope and risk
			may be limited to one server or the whole network - can have dramatic effects
			how long will change take?
			Is risk, high, medium or low?
				Fixes can break other things
				Is there a risk from NOT changing? - security updates
				
		make a plan
			detailed, technical info - complete picture
			Schedule with completion timeframe
			
		get approval of users
			end users decide if a change is worth it
			ideally a formality

		present proposal to change control board
			app parts of the org are represented
			some changes may be rescheduled
			
		have a backup plan if change doesn't work
			change may not always go right
			prepare for the worst
			some changes can be hard to revert
			always have backups
			
		document the changes
			everyone needs to know the changes
			track changes over time
