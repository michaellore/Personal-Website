====== 4.3 â€“ Implement basic disaster prevention and recovery methods ======

Need to have a plan for disasters
	Always have a backup
		Image - bare metal complete backup, an exact copy of everything - recover an entire system
		File - copy individual files - may need to rebuild the os
		
	Critical apps
		often distributed across multiple servers
		data stored across databases - sometimes  both in cloud and local
		All info needed when restoring backup
	
	You need a backup but need to be able to restore too
		do disaster recovery testing - simulate a disaster
		do periodic audits of your backups
	
	UPS - uniterruptable power supply
		gives you short term power when main power goes out
		Offline/standby - constantly monitoring main power, switches over when power goes out
		Line-interactive - can slowly ramp up power during brownout
		Online/Double conversion - always running, no delay 
		Some have an autoshutdown feature to turn off devices when battery is low
	
	Surge suppresor
		power spikes diverted to ground
		storms, sudden outages
		Noise filters remove line noise
			Devibel levels, higher Db is better

	Cloud storage - data available everywhere
		lets you keep data offsite, no tape drives to manage
		Data not under direct control - needs to be strongly encrypted
	
	Account recovery - apps don't work if users can't use
		Windows domain backups
		consider multifactor auth methods
		central admin is good - avoids local accounts, easier to restore
