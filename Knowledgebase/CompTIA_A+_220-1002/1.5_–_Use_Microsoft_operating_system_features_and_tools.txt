**Users and Groups**
	Admin - windows super user
	Guest - limited access if enabled
	Regular user - starndard access, running apps

		Account policies - passwords and lockouts
			enforce max password age, minimum length, etc
		Local - auditing, user rights, security options
		Windows defender firewall

**Performance Monitor** - long term usage stats, Disk use, memory use, CPU use
	set alerts to monitor and automate actions
	store statistics for long term analysis and reports
	
**Services** - background processes, no user interactions. Services.msc or control panel/admin tools
	file indexing, antivirus, network browsing

		granular security - define protocol/ports, scope, action and profile

**System Config** - msconfig or Control panel/admin tools

		Startup tab - choose which prgrams start on login - has been moved to task manager
		
		Tools tab - easy access to popular admin tools
			UAC settings, system info, computer management

**Task Manager** - real time system stats, CPU, ram, disk access, network usage

		Healthy 
		Healthy (at risk) - could be failing
		Initializing - normal startup message
		Failed - cannot be started automatically, disk is damaged or file system corrupt
	If in a RAID 1 or 5 array:
		Failed redundancy - a dirve has failed and must be replaced
		Resynching - mirrored (raid 1) volume is synching between drives
		Regenerating - raid 5 is recreating data based on the parity data
	
	Mount a drive - Extend available storage space by mounting a new storage device as a folder
		Mount in a folder - instant space, seamless for the user
			in disk management - right click, change drive letter, mount in empty ntfs folder
	
	If you have partitioned too much space, you can right click, Shrink volume, to create a new volume
		If you need to make a volume bigger, right click and Extend volume
