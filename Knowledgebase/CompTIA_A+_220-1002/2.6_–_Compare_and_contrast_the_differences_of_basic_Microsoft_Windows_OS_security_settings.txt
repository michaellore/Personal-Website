====== 2.6 â€“ Compare and contrast the differences of basic Microsoft Windows OS security settings ======

User and Groups
	Admin - super user
	Guest - limited access
	Standard user
	
	Groups
		power users - gives regular users some more permissions, not as many as admin

NTFS permissions apply for local and network connections
	permissions inherited from parent objects

Share permissions only apply to connections over the network
	most restrictive setting wins - deny beats allow
	
Administrative shares  
	hidden shares created during install (C$)
	local shares are created by users
	
	System files and folders
		C$, ADMIN$, PRINT$
	
	view shares with net share command or Computer management / shared folders
	
Explicit permissions - set default permissions for a share

Inherited permissions - propagated from parent to child
	set once, applies to everything underneath

Explicit permissions take precedence over inherited - even inherited deny permissions

User authentication
	proves you are account holder
	user/password
	
	Single sign on - common in business
		log in once - access all resources
		managed through kerberos

Run as admin - special priviliges - edit system files, install services
	not on by default - have to choose, right click and choose or ctrl-shift-enter

Bitlocker - encrypt entire volume, including the os
	data always protected even if physical drive is removed
	Bitlocker to go - encrypted removable usb flash drives
	
EFS - encrypting file system
	encrypt at filesystem level with NTFS - files and folders without encrypting entire os
	available in pro and higher versions of windows
	username and password encrypt key - resets make files inaccessible
