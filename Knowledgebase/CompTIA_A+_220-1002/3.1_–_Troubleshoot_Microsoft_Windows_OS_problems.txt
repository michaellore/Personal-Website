====== 3.1 â€“ Troubleshoot Microsoft Windows OS problems ======

**Common issues:**
	Slow System performance - hard to troubleshoot, many causes
		Task manager- check for high cpu use and hard drive utilization
		Windows update - an update could fix it
		Disk space - needs enough for windows to read and write, HDD may need defragging
		Laptop may be in power saver mode to save heat and battery
		Anti-virus scans can detect malware
	
	Limited connectivity - yellow triangle or exclamation point - no internet access
		check physical connection / connection to wireless
		check ip address config
		try a reboot
		could be an external issue - router is off or needs a reboot
		try pinging both router and an external ip
	
	Boot error - can't find os
		boot loader replaced or changed - multiple os installed
		check boot drives
		try Startup Repair
		may need to manually modify boot config
			command prompt recovery console - bootrec /rebuildbcd
			will look for installed version of windows
	
	Startup repair
		Missing NTLDR - main boot loader is missing
		run startup repair, disconnect removable media
		
		Missing operating system - boot config data may be incorrect
		boots to safe mode
	
	App crashes - app may provide an erorr or disappear
		check event log
		check reliability monitor - history of app problems
		try reinstalling the application
		
	Spontaneous shutdowns - blue screen of death
		bad hardware, drivers, application
		Use last known good, system restore, or rollback driver
			try Safe Mode
		Reseat or remove new hardware
		Run hardware diagnostics - from manufacturer
	
	Black screen - no login/desktop
		start in VGA mode with F8 on startup
		Run system file check SFC from recovery console
		update drivers in safe mode
		use startup repair/refresh or recover from backup
	
	Printer
		print or scan a test page from inside printer properties
		Use diagnostic tools built into printer, web based app, or os
	
	Hardware not starting
		check device manager - often a bad driver
			remove and allow system to replace
	
	Service fails to start
		bad driver, bad hardware
		check account permissions
		confirm service dependencies
		Windows service - check system files
		Application service - reinstall
		
	Slow boot - boot process hangs or takes a long time
		check what apps are starting on boot
		or, disable all and add one by one
		
		Roaming user profile - your desktop follows you to any computer, changes are synced
			may be network latency
			may pick a rmeote domain controller instead of local

**Troubleshooting Solutions**
	Defragmentation - movies file fragments so they are contiguous, improves read and write times on HDD, not SSD
		drive properties - Defragment Now
		scheduled weekly automatically
	
	Reboot - sometimes, it just works.
		app using too many resources
		memory leak bug can consume all your ram - reboot clears the RAM
	
	Kill task - find the problem app and kill it. Task manager - processes
	
	Services - similar issues as an app can have
		restart or stop
	
	Network - one config mismatch can cause problems
		auto mostly works
		speed and duplex setting - both sides should match, device and switch
		Check event viewer - driver may not give info
	
	Reimage or reload OS - windows is huge
		can't always find the needle, sometimes just build a new haystack
		many orgs will have prebuilt known-good images
		at home you can reset - settings / update & security / recovery
		
	Roll back - rewind to an earlier point
		restore point created during app updates, new installs, other major changes
		Device drivers can break, roll back on bootup with F8
	
	Updates - many issues solved with Windows Update
		lots of flexibility - install times
		apps must be updated by you manually
	
	Repair application
		some apps have a repair function to fix missing/corrupted files, registry issues
	
	Update boot order
		Booting from a usb drive - need to put it above primary, every bios is different 
	
	Disable startup services/apps - hard to tell what the problem is
		trial and error
		task manage, or control panel/admin tools/services
	
	Safe mode - windows 7 and 8
		Press F8 on boot, advanced boot options
		only necessary drivers get loaded
		command prompt
		low-rez vga mode
	
	Safe mode - windows 10
		F8 probably won't work - fast startup, prevents complete shutdown
		From desktop:
			Hold down shift key when clicking restart
			Settings/Update and security/Recover/Advanced startup/restart now
			or configure in System config  - msconfig
		
		interrupt boot process 3 consecutive times and boot options screen will appear
			Troubleshoot - advanced - see more recovery - startup settings

	Rebuild windows profiles - domain profiles can corrupt
		Profile service may fail logon - user profile cannot be loaded.  user docs "missing"
		Delete existing corrupt profile - login with domain admin rights
		rename \Users\name folder - saves important files
		Backup user's registry - HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
			right click and export
		Delete the existing registry
			will be rebuilt when user logs in
		Login with user's login - profile and registry will be rebuilt
			will recreate \Users\name folder
		Logout as user, log in as domain admin
			copy over important files from backup renamed folder
				only important docs - not all files as they could be corrupted
