====== 1.8 â€“ Configure Microsoft Windows networking on a client/desktop ======

Homegroup vs Workgroup vs Domain

Homegroup - designed for home use - share within your home private network
	Removed from Windows 10
	Network must be set to "Home"
	Single password for the all the device son the homegroup to access media

Workgroup - logical groups of network devices, each device is a standalone system, everyone is a peer - could mean different logins for each different system in the group
	Small departments
	Each computer has its own user info
	Not Centralized
	Control Panel / System

Windows Domain - business network, centralized authentication and access across many devices and networks
	Active directory domain services
	Designed for enterprise
	User accounts are centralized
	devices added to the domain
	Deploy software, updates
	Need to be on Windows Pro or higher
	Control Panel / System / Change settings / Join domain by clicking Network ID
	
Windows Network Technology
	Windows 7 - automatically change security settings based on what network you are on
		Home - trusted
		Work - can see other devices, can't join a homegroup
		Public - you are invisible to external devices
	
	Windows 8/10
		Private - sharing and connections
		Public - no sharing
		Network and internet status - change connection properties

Remote Access
	Remote assistance - windows home
		one time remote access - single use passwords
		chat, diagnostics
	
	Remote Desktop Connection - non-home windows
		ongoing access
		local authentication - normal user/pass
		may need port forwarding

Proxy
	Manage traffic flow - internet middleman
	Internet properties / LAN settings
	Can set proxy server and exceptions

Network shares - make a folder sharable across network
	assign a map drive letter to the share - reconnect automatically
	Shares ending with $ are hidden but you can connect manually - not for security
	CP / Admin tools / Computer management
	Access a share -> This PC - map network drive
		net use x: \\server\sharename

Printer share - similar to file share
	Users can add in windows explorer - search for a printer

Network Setup - CP / Network and Share
	Set up new connection - use wizard
	VPN concentrator - creates a secure tunnel between your device and a corporate or secure network
		connect to vpn instea dof directly to the secure network
		Built in VPN client - after configuring you can connectusing network status icon in taskbar
	
	Dialup - Modem phone line connection
		authenitcation and phone number
	
	Wireless WiFi
		Network name - SSID Service Set ID
		Security type - WEP, WPA2
		Encryption - TKIP, AES
		Security key - pre-shared password
			WPA-2 Enterprise uses 802.1x auth - uses normal password instead of preshared
	
	Ethernet - direct, fastest connection, used as the default 
	
	In adapter properties can set IP and DNS
	
	Wireless WAN - built in mobile tech
		Hardware adapter
		Phone tethering or hotspot

Firewall should always be enabled - can tmep. disable for troubleshooting
	change settings for public/private networks
	turn on and off notifications
	Allow/disallow specific apps, port numbers
	Choose from predefined exceptions, or define custom rules
	
Windows IP Address Config
	Uses DHCP by default - automatic IP provisioning
	If DHCP does not work
		APIPA private address is given - link local address
		169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255
		no internet connectivity, only on local network
		
		If APIPA is not wanted, you can manually set an alternative config
	
	Static IP - assigned manually - permanent association with device, need to know all specific
		IP Address - unique on network
		subnet mask
		Gateway - route of the subnet to the rest of the world
		DNS - domain name - resolves ip addresses to names
	
	DHCP can assign dynamic or static IP
	
	Loopback address is 127.0.0.1 - references local computer
	
	Work environments usually have multiple redundant DHCP servers
	
Network Adapter Properties
	Link speed and duplex / Speed and Duplex - adapter card properties - Advanced
		Auto negotiation does not always work
	Wake on LAN - computer sleeps until needed, useful for late night updates
	Quality of Service QoS - prioritize certain traffic like VOIP and video
		Differentiated Services Code Points DSCP
			Value assigned to give apps different priority
			Computer config - windows settings - policy based QoS
			Arbitrary number value - network admin has a QoS that prioritizes traffic based on configs 
	
	BIOS settings - enable and disable adapters, on and off, not much nuance
