	Advantages:
		Large industry support - almost every app written for Windows
		Many OS options - home and business
		Wide software support
		Custom hardware options
	
	Disadvantages:
		Large install base = big target for security exploits
		Supporting so much hardware can be hard to integrate

Apple's MacOS - desktop designed to run on Apple hardware
	Advantages:
		Easy to use
		Extremely compatible
		Fewer security concerns
	
	Disadvantages:
		Requires Apple hardware
		less industry support
		Higher initial hardware cost
		
Linux - Free Unix-compatible software system
	Many different distributions - Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat/Fedora, many many more
	
	Advantages:
		Free!
		Wide hardware support
		Passionate user community
		
	Disadvantages:
		Limited driver suuport - especially laptops
		Limited support options

**OS Technologies**
32 bit vs 64 bit
	32 bit processors can store 2^{32 }= 4,294,967,296 values
		Can only support 4GB of memory
	
	64 bit processors can store 2^{64} = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values
		4GB vs 17 billion GB
		OS has a max supported value
	
	Hardware drivers are specific to OS version
		32-bit uses x86 drivers
		64-bit uses x64 drivers
	
	32 bit OS cannot run 64-bit apps
		64bit can run 32bit apps
			32bit apps stored in \Program Files (x86)
			64 bit apps stored in \Program Files

**Windows on mobile devices**
	Windows 10 on fully featured tablets
		Early tablets used a less-featured os called Windows Mobile - dev stopped, no support after December 2019

**Phones**
	Android - open handset alliance
		open source OS based on linux
		Apps developed with Android SDK
		Apps available on Google Play store and third party sites and stores
	
	Apple iOS -  used on iphone and ipad
		Based on Unix
		Only on Apple hardware
		Closed source - no access to source code
		Apps developed with iOS SDK on MacOS
		apps must be approved by Apple
		Apps are in Apple App store

**Choosing an OS:**
	End of life - different companies set their own EOL policies
	Updates - iOS, Android, Windows 10 check and prompt, Chrome OS auto updates
	Compatibility between OSs - some movies and music can be sure
		Almost no direct app compatibility - Windows apps can't run on Mac
		Some data files can be shared
		Web-apps are a potential solution
