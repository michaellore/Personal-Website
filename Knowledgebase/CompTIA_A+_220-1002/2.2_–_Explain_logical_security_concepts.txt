====== 2.2 â€“ Explain logical security concepts ======

Active Directory
	Centralixed management to limit and control access
	Login scripts can manage app updates and antivirus
	Set group policies for complex passwords, login time restrictions
	
	Organized in Organization Units
		Based on locations or departments
	
	Home folder - network share as user's home
		folder redirection - instead of a local folder, redirect to the server
		Access files from anywhere

Mobile Device Management (MDM)
	manage company and user owned devices - BYOD Bring your own device
	Central management of mobile devices
	set policies on apps, data, camera
	Control the remote device, set partitions for personal/company data
	Manage access control - force PIN or password

Port security
	prevent unauthorized users from connecting to the switch interface
		Alert or disable the port
	Monitoring based on Source MAC address
	Each port has its own config - unique rules for each interface
		Ex - configure max number of source MAC addresses on interface, disable if exceeded

MAC filtering - media access control "hardware" address
	limit access through physical hardware address
	additional admin required - gusts must be manually added
	Easy to find working addresses through wireless lan analysis
		MAC address can be spoofed
		Security though obscurity

Smart card - physical card to provide digital access - a digital certificate
	Multiple factors - commonly used with a pin or password

Certififcate based Auth
	Smart card - private key on card
	PIV card - personal id verification card - US Fed smart card
	CAC - common access card - US department of defense
	IEEE 802.1X - gain access using a certificate, on-device storage or a separate physical device

Antivirus and antimalware
	runs on the computer
	signatures must be uipdated constantly
		becomes a scaling issue
		need to be tracke din large orgs - enterprise management tools
	mobility adds more challenge

Host-based "personal firewall"
	Software based
	included in many OSes, 3rd party solutions
	Stops unauthorized access
	"stateful", blocks traffic by app or port

Network firewall
	filters traffic by port number
	Next gen firewalls can identify app
	Some can encrypt your traffic in a vpn tunnel
	Can proxy your traffic
	Most can also be a router
	
User auth
	Identifier - unique, in Windows it is a Security Identifier (SID)
	Credential - password, smart card, pin, etc
	Profile - info stored about the user, name contact info, groups

Passwords
	Weak passwords can be brute force donline or offline with a password list
	Should be complex and refreshed often
	
Multifactor
	something you are - biometric
	something you have - smart card
	something you know - password
	somewhere you are - gps check
	something you do - signature
	can be expensive - hardware tokens
	can be inexpensive - software app token generators
		pseudo random - changes constantly, can't guess

Directory permissions
	NTFS
		much more granular than FAT
		lock down access
		prevent accidental mods or deletion
	User permission
		not everyone should be Admin
		may ned to run audits

VPN concentrator
	encrypt data moving across a public network
	may be hardware or software
	Sometimes built in os, or third party
	
Data loss prevention (DLP)
	stop the data before the bad guy gets it
	so many data sources and destinations, need solutions in different places

Access control list (ACL)
	allow or deny traffic
	also used for NAT, QoS
	often on router or switch
	incoming and outgoing traffic
	evaluate based on IP, ports, icmp

Email filtering
	stop unsolicited email at the gateway - onsite or cloud based
	scan and block malicious software
	phishing attempts
	suspicious attachments

Trusted software source
	consider the source
	internal apps, well known publisher, digitally signed apps
	Untrusted sources - third party sites, links from email, pop ups

Least privilige 
	Rights and permissions should only get exactly what they need
	apps run with minimum priviliges
	Don't allow admin priviliges
