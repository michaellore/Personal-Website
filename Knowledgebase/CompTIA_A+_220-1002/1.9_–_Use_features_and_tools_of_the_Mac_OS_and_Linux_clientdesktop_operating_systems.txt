====== 1.9 â€“ Use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems ======

**MacOS**
	MacOS scheduled backups - Time Machine
		Hourly backups for last 24 hours
		Daily backups for last month
		Weekly backups for previous months
		Deletes oldest backups when disk is full
		Familiar Finder UI - dates along right side
		If time machine is unavailable macOS takes snapshots and when Time Machine is available it is updated
	
	Scheduled disk maintenance
		Disk utility
		Rarely needed, no ongoing maintenance
		First Aid - similar to windows check disk
	
	Centralized updates for both the OS and apps in the App store
		Automatic - but can do manually
		Patch management - view previous updates
	
	Driver/firmware updates are mostly invisible - designed to be hidden from user
		Can see some info in System Information - read-only
	
	MacOS does not have antivirus built in
		many 3rd party options - make sure to automate virus signature definitions
		Fewer threats than windows, smaller install base
		
	Image Recovery - use disk utility to make a disk image file
		Apple Disk Image .dmg file
		Mount on a MacOS system
			appears as a normal file system, can copy files from image
		Restore a disk image to a volume
		File system utilities - verify and repair, modify partitions, erase disks
	
	Terminal - command line access, no GUI

	Screen sharing - Integrated into OS
		also viewed with VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
		Devices appear in the finder
			can also access by IP or name
			
	Force Quit - stop a frozen ap from executing
		open with CMD + OPTION + ESC
		Hold Option key when right clicking app in Dock
		
	Mission Control and Spaces
		Quickly view all running apps
		Swipe upwards with 3 fingers or CTRL + Up Arrow
		Spaces - create multiple desktops from top of screen in Mission Control
	
	Keychain - password management - all passwords saved here
		Integrated into OS
		Website, app passwords
		Encrypted with 3DES - need login password for access
	
	Spotlight - searching within the OS, like windows Search
		magnifying glass in upper right
		Command+Space
		define categories in System prefs / Spotlight
	
	iCloud - integrates apple hardware across macos and ios - backup and sync across platforms
		similar to google drive.dropbox
	
	Gestures - more than point and click
		one, two or three fingers
		customize in System prefs / Trackpad
	
	Finder - central os file manager, file servers, remote storage, screen sharing
	
	Remote Disc - use an optical drive from another computer
		Designed for copying files
		does not work with audio CDs or video DVD
		Sharing options in System Prefs
		Integrated into Finder
	
	Dock - similar ot windows taskbar
		Quick launch apps
		Active apps have dot underneath
		Folders can be in the dock
	
	Boot Camp - dual built into Windows on Mac hardware
		Requires Apples device drivers
		Managed through boot camp assistant

**Linux**
	Many different ways to perform tasks
	
	Scheduled backups - command line and graphical
		tar - tape archive, easy to make a script for a backup schedule
		
		rsync - sync files between storage devices
			instant or scheduled

	Very little disk maintenance required
		Check file system - file system can't be mounted
			done after X numbe rof reboots
			Force after reboot by adding a file to root with command:
				sudo touch /forcefsck
		Clean up log files in /var/log/

	System update utilities
		apt-get, yum commands
		graphical update manager "software updater"
		Patch management - can schedule updates
		Software Center "linux app store"
		
	Many drivers are built into the kernel and update with the kernel
		Other drivers are installed through software updates or command line
	
	Fewer viruses than Windows generally, but still important
		ClamAV - open source
		always keep signatures up to date
		real time protection is best
	
	Backup tools may be built into the distribution - check docs
		often there is a GUI with scheduling
		command line always available - rsync
	
	Image recovery not as robust as in Windows, but some exist
		dd command built into Linux
			convert and copy a file
			backup and restore an entire partition, very powerful
		3rd party, GNU parted, clonezilla
		
	Screen sharing might be built into distro, or third party
		Remmina, UltraVNC

**Basic Linux Commands**
	commands are similar in Linux and MacOS
	
	man <command> for help
		man grep
	
	ls - list directory contents, dir in windows
		ls -l for long output
			ls -l | more to make pages
			q to quit or CTRL + C
	
	cd - change directory - uses forward slash / instead of backslash \ like Windows
	
	grep - find text in a file or many files
		grep PATTERN [file name]
			grep failed auth.log
			is case sensitive
	
	su/sudo - run command as root user
		su - become a super user
		sudo - execute one command as super user
	
	shutdown - shut the system down safely in software
		sudo shutdown 2 - shutdown in 2 minutes
		sudo shutdown -r 2 - shutdown in 2 minutes then reboot
		crtl+C or shutdown -c - cancel shutdown
	
	pwd vs passwd
		pwd - print working directory, by default terminal shows a ~, ~ is short for working directory
		
		passwd - change a user account password
			passwd [username]

	mv - rename a file
		mv SOURCE DEST
			mv first.txt second.txt - renames first.txt to second.txt
	
	cp - copy a file
		cp SOURCE NEWFILE
			cp second.txt third.txt
	
	rm - remove a file or directory (delete)
		Does not remove directories by default - must be empty or removed with -r flag
			rm second.txt
	
	mkdir - make a new directory
		mkdir NAME
	
	chmod - change mode of a file system object
		r = read permission
		w = write permission
		x = execute permissions
		set permissions for owner (u), group (g), others (o) or all (a)
			can use octal notation
			{{.\pasted_image.png}}
			chmod MODE FILE
				__chmod 744 file.txt__
					gives owner full [7] [rwx]
					gives group read only [4] [r--]
					gives others read only [4][r--]
				__chmod a-w first.txt__
					all users [a] no writing [w]
				__chmod u+x first.txt__
					owner [u] can execute [x]

	chown - change file owner and group
		sudo chown [OWNER:GROUP] file
			sudo chown mike first.txt
	
	iwconfig - view and change wireless network config
		essid, frequency/channel, mode, rate - requires knowledge of the network
			iwconfig eth0 essid studio-wireless
	
	ifconfig - view and configure a wired network interface and IP config

		handles unstalling and updating software packages
			sudo apt-get install wireshark

		dd if=<source file> of <target file> [options]

			dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/sda-image.img
		To restore, simply reverse
			dd if=/tmp/sda-image.img of=/dev/sda
	
	killall - terminate programs
		sudo killall firefox
		xkill - graphical interface for kill
