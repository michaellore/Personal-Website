====== 1.7 â€“ Summarize application installation and configuration concepts ======

Applications extend function of the os, found anywhere, usually on the internet.
Consider: Drive space requirements, RAM (more than just os needs), OS compatibility

Local install - downloaded executable/usb flash/CD, installs on local computer

Network-based - default in most companies, apps are stored and deployed from a central server

Local user permissions - programs need folder/file access that the amdin might have to grant
	some apps will install new Services or drivers - be careful

Applications have the same permissions as the user - unknown apps can cause issues - delete files, access the network, etc
