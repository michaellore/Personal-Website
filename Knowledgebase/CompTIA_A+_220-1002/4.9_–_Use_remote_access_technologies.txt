====== 4.9 â€“ Use remote access technologies ======

Remote desktop protocol RDP - share desktop remotely ove rport 3389
	many windows versions
	connect to entire desktop or individual app
	Clients for windows, mac, linux, mobile

Telnet - port 23
	console based view into another device
	Not encrypted - not great for production systems

SSH secure shell Port 22
	similar look and feel to telnet, but is encrypted

Third party tools
	VNC - virtual network computing
		remote frame buffer (RFB protocol)
		clients for many os, many open source
	
	Commercial solutions
		teamviewer, logmein
		screen sharings, file sharing
		
Security concerns
	Microsoft remote desktop - open port 3389 is a big tell. 
		Brute force attacks are common
	
	Third party solutions mostly use a username and passwords
		many combos are reused across wbesites
		once you're in, you're in
			make purchases from user's browser, etc
