Use power strip/surge protector 
	noise filters remove line noise - higher Db is better
	amount of surge protection measured in Joules - higher is better, aim for 600
	Surge amp ratings - higher is better
	UL 1449 voltage let through ratings
		500, 400, 330 volts, lower is better

Enclosures - protect devices in manufacturing area - dust, oil, smoke
